Unidentified : Light a little better. And then, uh, come a little lower please. And then step to your left. Yes. Perfect. Wonderful.

Unidentified : Thank you.

Question : All right. Um, why don't you tell me, what inspired you to make this documentary?

Melania Trump: Well, my life, it's, uh --

President Trump : Mr. Senator Schumer, we've gotten along very well. We're working on trying to get it to stay open and we'll see what happens. It's in the process.

Question : Mr. President, Amazon paid $75 million to make and market this film, an exorbitant fee. Many Americans, um, think that this is maybe Jeff Bezos trying to get in good with you and they would call it an act --

Trump : Who are you?

Question : -- of corruption.

Trump : Who are you with?

Question : The New York Times.

Trump : [Laughs] Oh. The fake, fake news, New York. No. I don't know.

Question : Mr. President --

Trump : I mean, really, I'm not involved in, that was done with my wife. Uh, I think it's gonna be, I think it's a very important, it will be. I think it's really gonna be very important. It shows life in the White House, a big deal actually.

Question : What was Tulsi Gabbard doing at an election center in Georgia today?

Trump : She's working very hard on trying to keep the election safe and she's done a very good job and, and they, uh, as you know, they got into the votes. You've got to sign judge's order in Georgia. And, uh, you're gonna see some interesting things happening. They've been trying to get there for a long time.

Question : Will you be pulling back immigration, um, enforcement agents out in Minnesota?

Trump : No. We want to keep our country safe. We'll do whatever we can to keep our country safe.

Question : So, yeah, pulling back?

Trump : No, no. Not at all. No.

Question : Sir, Mr. President, what are your --

Question : Mr. President, Imbal with One America News. Nice to see you, sir.

Question : Nice to see you, my friend. How are you?

Question : Uh, tonight is about the First Lady. No offense to you, I'm not gonna ask political questions. I'm gonna talk about this amazing woman and this amazing film. We're gonna see you two interact like never before I heard from the director and producers. Is that true?

Trump : You are going to see that. I'm not sure I'm thrilled with that --

Question : [Laughs]

Trump : -- but that's, that's all right. No, it's very good. I got to see it for the first time the other night. It's really good, glamorous. Very glamorous. We need s- -- we need some glamour in the country, so.

Question : Well, you're bringing that back. What do you want the country to know about your amazing wife or amazing First Lady that 99% of this fake news never tells the country or the world?

Trump : Well, she's a very serious person, very, very brilliant person actually, and, uh, speaks many languages, but that's the least of it. She's doing a great job. She's very popular. The people of the country really love her.

Question : Brenton Yon told me that she's very influential, more than most folks might think because she's so private and reserved. How true is that? How much are you talking to the First Lady when it comes to policies and things? Not about Barron and family, but about the country.

Trump : Great influence. She's, uh, really a historian in a true sense. She knows, uh, a lot about the history of a lot of different countries, especially this one, and she's very influential. She's, uh, somebody that I count on, you know? I speak to a lot of people, and I listen to some and I don't listen to others, but she's very influential.

Question : [Inaudible]

Trump : You'll see that tonight. I think you're gonna see that tonight.

Question : Mr. President --

Question : Thank you, Mr. President.

Question : -- are you not in the movie?

Trump : No, I'm in the movie. [Laughs]

Question : Mr. President, a lot has happened --

Question : Mr. President --

Question : That sounded like fake news, didn't it? No, you're not in the movie. [Laughs]

Trump : Probably the New York Times.

Question : He's in the movie, guys.

Question : -- how do you think January 2026-

Trump : They got the election wrong, the New York Times, you know?

Question : They get a lot wrong in the New York Times, Mr. President.

Trump : They said that, they got a lot wrong, but they did. They got the election wrong. They haven't apologized yet.

Question : What day will you be announcing your Fed Chair pick next week?

Trump : Uh, tomorrow morning.

Question : Tomorrow morning.

Question : Oh.

Question : Do you know who you'd pick?

Trump : I do. And, otherwise I have to go to work very quickly. No. I'll be announcing the Fed Chair tomorrow morning.

Question : Mr. President --

Question : Mr. President, a lot has happened this month. How do you think January 2026 is going to factor into your legacy?

Trump : Uh, I think that, uh, the legacy is very strong right now. We have the safest country. We've had the strongest military. We're doing better than we've ever done before. I think it's, it's gonna be a great legacy.

Question : I would love to talk to the First Lady. It's her night.

Trump : I'm sure you will.

Question : Can we do that? Guys, can we give politics a break for a second?

Question : How are you going --

Question : Since it's her night and her movie?

Trump : Great friend of ours, honey.

Melania Trump: How are you?

Question : Hi. Nice to see you, Melania. Let's talk about this film. [Inaudible]

Melania Trump: Yes.

Trump : Well, I'm looking at the, the whole thing, but, you know, I have a, a great feeling. I like both of them very much, but it looks to me like one is very much a monopoly if they're able to do this, so we'll see how it all works.

Question : What do you think people will come away from this film? What do you think they will be feeling?

Trump : I think they're gonna see a glamour that they haven't seen before and I think our country needs glamour. You understand glamour better than most. But, uh, they're gonna understand glamour. A lot about the beauty and the pageantry and things we haven't seen in a long time.

Question : Mr. President, what is the next war you'll be solving? Does President Putin want peace?

Trump : Well, we're gonna see. I think we're gonna have peace. We're gonna get the peace down.

Question : Mr. President, do you believe you'd be the man you are today if you hadn't met your wife?

Trump : That's an interesting question. I better be very careful about that.

Melania Trump: Um, I'm very, very proud of him.

Trump : It's a very dangerous --

Question : [Laughs]

Trump : He's asking me a very dangerous question. Uh, I think she's really been a great help.

Question : It's a red carpet. what are you wearing?

Trump : She's done a great job.

Question : We forgot to ask.

Trump : Very respected. Very smart, very measured, very measured. Sometimes when I'm not so measured, she's, she measure- -- measures you, but, uh, no, she's done a great job. And very, very influential in terms of the administration. Yes.

Question : And Mr. President, with everything --

Trump : He's asking me very dangerous questions.

Question : [Laughs]

Trump : I asked your husband if he would be the man he is today, if he had never met you. What do you think?

Melania Trump: Well, we will all be in different places, I guess. [Laughs] Right?

Question : Mr. President --

Trump : We like, we do like the way it worked out.

Melania Trump: Right.

Question : [Laughs] And Mrs. Trump, what do you want Americans to learn about him first --

Trump : He did.

Question : -- and yourself in this film?

Question : -- went very well.

Melania Trump: Well, they will see the conditions [Inaudible]

Question: They wanted to know a little bit more about the details of that conversation.

Trump : Well, it was not much of a conversation other than he said that he'd love to see peace, but I want to see peace, I think maybe more than anyone. And we've done a great job. We've closed the border. We've stopped crime. Crime's at an all time low in the history of our country. And that's only because we're taking criminals out. We're taking some very bad people out of our country, but, uh, I want to see that also.

Melania Trump: -- so I think they would enjoy it.

Question : Do you think this film will change the minds of non-Trump supporters and maybe garner the president more fans?

Question : And Mr. President, what do you say to those that are critical of the fact that Amazon paid $40 million to acquire the rights of this movie?

Trump : Well, I think they'd have to go and ask President Obama who got paid a lot of money and hasn't done anything. So I think they probably have to go because, uh, if you take a look at others, they've been paid a lot of money, but this is somebody, Melania, who really produced and she's, she's done a great thing. This is a very important piece of work.

Question : And what do you hope people learn about your wife after seeing this film?

Trump : Well, I think they knew she was smart, but perhaps, uh, maybe, uh, they'll get, uh, to see something that, uh, elevates above just the word smart. She's got a lot of, lot of high quality.

Question : And you have an entertainment background yourself --

Trump : I do.

Question : -- creating several hit shows. Did you have any sort of creative input on this film? Did you watch any of the screeners in advance?

Trump : I really had none. I saw it for the first time two nights ago. I loved it. I thought it was really great, but it really brings back a glamour that you just don't see anymore. Our country can use a little bit of that, right? You would know that, right?

Question : Well, can you tell me a little bit more about the split off on the Department of Homeland Security on the shuts avoiding a shutdown?

Trump : Well, I think what you're going to see is, uh, you will know by the time this movie's over what's going to happen. And I'll be naming the Fed tomorrow morning. I'll be, I've chosen a very good person to head the Fed. I'll be putting that out tomorrow morning.

Question : Are there any details you can share about the [Inaudible] September?

Melania Trump: I think for myself [Inaudible]

Trump : No.

Question : Mr. President, what is, what is your message to the tens of millions of Trump voters on this film about the First Lady?

Trump : Uh, that she's a very smart person, very influential person, and she cares about the country, loves the country, just like Breitbart does, actually. And, uh, she's done a great job. Very popular.

Question : Mr. President, and there's also been some leftist outlets already pushing negative coverage around this film before it's even come out. What do you say to that, and what can MAGA do to combat that?

Trump : Well, you know, that's standard with these people and, you know, they, they like to do it. They lost an election in a landslide. They do whatever they can. But we have a safe country. We have a rich country. We've taken in hundreds of billions of dollars of tariff money. We're, we've never been in a position like us. We're strong. We're financially powerful. We're militarily powerful. I built the military in my first term and now we have a, a group headed out to a place called Iran, and hopefully we won't have to use it.

Question : And lastly, Mr. President, this is, uh, today was your 10th cabinet meeting. Over the course of four years, Joe Biden only held nine cabinet meetings. What does that say about the transparency of your administration versus the last administration?

Trump : And I had cameras in my cabinet meetings, all of them, just about all of them. And so it's very transparent. There's never been an administration so transparent as us. We had a good cabinet meeting today. Uh, we talked about the economy. The economy is through the roof. Prices are way down. Uh, gasoline 1.99 a gallon. It was $4 a gallon just a year and a half ago. So a lot of great things are happening as you know.

Question : Absolutely. And people are going to start seeing some relief with their tax returns.

Trump : I think so, and they're going to be, you know, the Great Big Beautiful Bill just kicked in.

Melania Trump: -- and Amazon was the best because they are visible --

Trump : And you're going to see some tremendous, uh, numbers. We have, uh, prices are down all throughout. You know, they like to talk about affordability, was is just a term that they made because, you know, but they're the ones that caused the problem.

Melania Trump : -- all the around the world. It's opening tomorrow all around the world.

Trump : We inherited a mess, and the prices are way down. We inherited an open border with millions of people coming in under the problems that you have, the big problems that you have. Millions of criminals were allowed into our country through an open border, and we're getting them out. We're getting them out fast.

Melania Trump : -- Have, uh, many of them and, uh, they're very successful. So, yes.

Trump : Uh, they just announced today crime in this country is at an all time low.

Question : And what does Barron think of the movie?

Melania Trump: He loved it. He loved it. Yes.

Question: Thank you.

Melania Trump: Thank you.

Trump : And that was done by Democrats. They said that the Democrats just released crime in this country is at an all time low. Thank you and you guys are great.

Question : Thank you. And could I ask one question?

Trump : Please.

Question : Madam First Lady, Nick Gilbertson, Breitbart News.

Melania Trump : How are you?

Question : I'm doing very good.

Trump : This is Hollywood Foreign Press.

Question : Um, what is something you hope that, uh, people, Americans [Inaudible]

Trump : [Inaudible] the Academy Awards used to get ratings. They don't get ratings anymore.

Melania Trump : But we will see what [Inaudible] takes to [Inaudible] again.

Question : [Inaudible] opera house [Inaudible].

Trump : I don't know anything about that.

Question : No.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Trump : Depends. What will she pay [Laughs]?

Question : [Inaudible]

Trump : That is a good man right there.

Question : What would you say are one or two of your favorite scenes from the documentary?

Trump : I just think the overall feel of it. It's such a, uh, such a beautiful piece. It's really, the cinematography is beautiful, the whole thing. I think you're gonna like it. I mean, people, people really like it. It's very different. Uh, I would think these are very hard times for movies, frankly, with, uh, since COVID, you know. Since COVID it's been very hard, but, uh, people, people really like it. I can see this being very successful over a period of time.

Question : Mr President --

Note: [Crosstalk]

Trump : It's also very much a history of the White House. You know it's a history, it's a modern day history of the White House.

Question : Do you think you'll want to do a movie next --

Trump : I don't know about that. I'll find out.

Question : How does your legacy differ from the First Lady's?

Trump : Say it?

Question : How does your legacy differ from the First Lady's?

Trump : Well, they're intertwined. We've had a good life. Uh, we've done a good job. Crime at an all time low. Uh, the economy at an all time high, we've never taken in, we've taken in 18 trillion dollars, think of that 18 trillion. Biden, as an example, last administration, less than one trillion in four years. We've taken in 18 trillion dollars in one year. It's actually more than that. So, I mean, it's, uh, it's been an amazing run. We're having a good time. Uh, what happened on the border, we have a closed border. We used to have an open border. Millions of people pouring in. A lot of criminals at the highest level, including 11,888 murderers. We don't want to have murderers in our country. I got 'em, a lot of them out. We're gonna get the rest of 'em out. But to have a country, you have to have a safe country.

Question : When might we see ICE in Springfield, Ohio? When might we see ICE in Springfield, Ohio?

Melania Trump: So, [Inaudible] are already in it. So that is my mission as the First Lady and --

Trump : Well, we're gonna see what's happening. Springfield is not a happy place with what they did. Uh, Springfield, I love Springfield, Ohio. I won Springfield, Ohio. But, uh, during the Biden administration, they did great damage to Springfield.

Question : Mr. President, why should, uh --

Question : Mr. President, What was it like seeing, what was it like seeing the documentary for the first time? And what did you learn? Did you learn something new about your wife?

Trump : Well, I don't think so, but I learned she's, uh, you know, just a, it's a confirmation more than anything else. Uh, very smart woman. A woman with influence, a woman who understands our country. Comes from another part of the world, but understands, uh, this country very well. Understands the world very well. So you're gonna see somebo- -- somebody that maybe you didn't know. But I, I think most people understood this is a very smart woman with influence.

Question : Mr. President, how should, why should audiences see this film? Even democrats who might not support you. And do you expect it to be a big hit?

Trump : Well, I think you'll learn about the White House, you'll learn about government. You learn about the First Lady. A little bit about me, not so much about me. You know me pretty much. I'm an open book. But you'll learn things that are, uh, very interesting. And it's a beautifully shot movie. You see the most beautiful scenes. It's, there's a great glamour to this. I was saying when I left, because I saw it three days ago for the first time. There's a great glamour, beautiful glamour. And you learn it's about the White House, it's about our country, and we need a little glamour. I like glamour.

Question : What was it like having Nicki Minaj in the Oval Office?

Trump : Nicki Minaj is fantastic. She's a terrific person. She was so nice and she understands, you know, what we're doing with the Trump accounts. We're helping children grow up. And when they're 18 years old they're gonna have a lot of money. They're gonna be rich. And, uh, she got it, but she's, she's been a supporter from the beginning and I think Nicki Minaj is a winner. She's fantastic.

Question : Can you talk about how the First Lady has been unspoken this term? Especially about, like --

Trump : She is. I noticed that myself. She is a little bit more unspoken, I think. Maybe, uh, that comes with time, but, uh, she's, she's done a great job. She very, she's a very popular, very respected First Lady. Thank you. Who are you with?

Question : Fox News Digital.

Trump : Good. Very good.

Question : Mr President, what can Americans learn about --

Question: Hey, I, I wanted to ask you, what is your family's reaction to the First Lady's film?

Trump : I think great. I mean, the, uh, Don is here tonight. And, uh, the others are seeing it tomorrow or the next day but, uh, very good. It's been very good.

Question : I saw the First Lady's father is here as well.

Trump : Yeah.

Question : And I've heard that Barron Trump is actually in town as well.

Trump : Barron saw it --

Question : And s --

Trump : -- two nights ago --

Question : Yes.

Trump : -- with us. Can, he loved it. Barron loved it. Barron is, uh, he, he thought, he thought [Laughs] it was great, I will say.

Question : Mr. President, what makes you proud of, um, Madame First Lady for doing, showing this story?

Trump : Well, I am proud of her. I mean, she's done a great job. This, a thing like this is not easy. And, you know, she comes from a far away country, a wonderful country, clean, beautiful, safe. [Laughs] They don't have, they don't have problems like others have. But she comes from a, a country that's a very safe country, very, um, good country in, uh, many ways. Uh, but it's different, and she's, uh, she's picking it up very easily. Speaks a lot of languages, very smart, understands what's happening, and really is a, uh, a good influencer of me. Thank you.

Question : Mr. President, you have a TV and film background. Did you have any input or any say on the creative r --

Trump : On this?

Question : Yeah. On this one.

Trump : Uh, I would say yeah. I mean, other than the fact that I'm in it.

Question : [Laughs]

Trump : I'm sort of in it, but, uh, I would say that basically this was, this was her baby and she, it's her views. It's her feel. And she's done a great job. I think you're gonna really like it. You're gonna love this one. This is a really good one. It's a beautiful movie. It's a documentary of sorts, but it explains the White House. You'll see the great beauty of the White House, the, uh, glamour of the White House, the fix-up. You know, I'm fixing the White House. I do that instinctively. I fix the White House. And it's in, uh, much better shape than it ever was. It's, it's in, I mean, Doug w- -- Doug can tell you. He wins the Pulitzer Prize every week. But Doug, that's a different building right now than it was –

Question : Sure.

Trump : -- uh, a year ago, right?

Question : Yes sir.

Trump : It's a beautiful, clean building that things are being repaired. I love doing it. I do it second nature. That's why I was good at real estate. So.

Question : And you had mentioned earlier --

Trump : Who are you with?

Question : I'm with the Daily Mail.

Trump : Good.

Question : Yeah. And you had mentioned earlier that Melania's been a little bit more outspoken this time around. Would you like to see --

Trump : A little bit it seems.

Question : -- more of that?

Trump : Well, somebody asked me the question.

Question : Yeah.

Trump : I think so. Yeah. I think she is. Well, she's, she's got stronger opinions now probably. She's seen, you know, experienced. It comes with experience. She's got stronger opinions. Go ahead.

Question : You're very business mindset person. What d --

Trump : Business oriented.

Question : Oriented. Thank you.

Trump : [Laughs]

Question : And I wanted to ask, h- -- how is the First Lady, um, also, uh --

Trump : Good.

Question : -- uh, uh, we're gonna see a little bit of that [Inaudible]

Trump : She's, she's g- -- you're gonna see it tonight.

Question : Yeah.

Trump : She's got a good business and a great fashion head.

Question : Yes.

Trump : She was friends with everybody. Until I ran for office, the fashion industry loved her more than anybody, and then I ran for office and, uh, she didn't care. [Laughs] But, uh, the fashion industry really loved her. And once I announced I'm running as a Republican, they didn't like, but now they're all coming to me and asking for help. And, uh, we, we give them help.

Question : Well, maybe the m- -- First Lady could also comment on this as well, but th- -- all of those l- fashion magazines snubbed to you during the first administration as well as now. Um, what is your message to them and what is something that you want people to take away from this film?

Melania Trump: Uh, here in this film, they will see a lot of, uh, emotion, fashion, grief, sadness, celebration, love. So, um, that's the message for the viewers.

Question : Mr. President --

Question : And Mr. President, real quick, if you don't mind.

Trump : It's been, you know, she's been very well received in terms of this. This is something s- -- I mean, I think you're gonna love it. A lot of you aren't allowed to say what you think because, you know, your editors don't want you to do it or the owners, but a lot of people do. Uh, I think you're gonna really love it. Yeah.

Question : Movie theaters are such a beautiful place for community and connectivity. Why do you think it's important that a film like this does release in theaters all over the country?

Trump : Well, it's nice that she did that because personally I think theaters are, it's a very tough business, the theaters [Inaudible] after COVID. And, you know, you look at it and you see. So, I think it's r- -- I think this will be unbelievable streaming and everything. Uh, theaters are a different, in a different world now. I study financial pages very closely. I look at theaters and the theater business and everything and it's, it's pretty much of a different world. But she wanted to get it out so people could see it. But I see this as a, in terms of streaming and everything, I think you're gonna love it. The glamour, the beauty, the whole thing, it's gonna be something that, uh, m- -- I don't want to say especially women, but I think maybe especially women, they're gonna love this movie.

Question : Thank you so much.

Trump : Thank you very much.

Question : Can you talk a little bit about your inspiration for, uh, focusing on the 20 days before inauguration?

Melania Trump: Well, it, it was my life. So, people will see it, uh, transitioning from the privatism to being the First Lady again. Uh, the schedule was very intense. Uh, they followed me from morning till evening and, uh, you will see what I have to do and what I did, uh, from planning the inauguration to running my business, philanthropy, taking care of the family, moving to the White House, uh, meeting with security detail, uh, establishing the East Wing, uh, and hiring, uh, the people that they need to work for me, but also they work for the American people.

Trump : Mm-hmm.

Question : Thank you.

Melania Trump: Thank you.

Question : Thank you.

Trump : Thank you very much. Who are you with?

Question : Fox News Digital, sir.

Trump : We like, we, we like.

Question : Um, now, sir, w- --

Trump : Who are you with?

Question : Daily Caller.

Trump : That's a good place.

Question : Yes.

Trump : It could be good most of the time. Thank you.

Question : Thank you so much.

Trump : Thank you.

Question : Mr. P- -- Mr. President, Mr. President.

Question : Thank you so much for, uh, taking the time. Are you trying to choke off Cuba?

Trump : Say it?

Question : Are you trying to choke off Cuba?

Trump : I don't know, the word choke off is awfully tough. Uh, Cuba is a failing nation and you have to feel badly for Cuba. They've treated people very badly. We have a lot of Cuban Americans who really were treated very badly, and they'd probably like to go back. And, uh, no, I'm not trying to, but, uh, it looks like it's something that's just not gonna be able to survive. I think Cuba will not be able to survive.

Question : Was there anything about the UK getting into China?

Question : Mr. President, Mr. President.

Trump : Hello, thank you, for your note, very much.

Question : Thank you.

Trump : Thank you.

Question : As you, as you were thinking about Fed chair --

Trump : Yeah.

Question : -- what were the characteristics that you were looking for in the end? And would it --

Trump : Well, I'll be announcing that tomorrow morning.

Question : What exactly tipped that person over the edge into this?

Trump : Uh, I'd rather say it tomorrow, but just an outstanding person and a person that, uh, won't be too surprising to people. A lot of people, uh, a lot of people think that this is somebody that could have been there a few years ago. Uh, it's gonna be, uh, somebody that is very respected, somebody that's known to everybody in the financial world. And I, I think it's gonna be a very good choice. So, I hope so. I mean, it's good for --

Question : So, it's someone who was on your shortlist, sir?

Trump : Uh, on my reasonably shortlist, yeah.

Question : Mr. President, what do you --

Question : Mr. President, about The Fed.

Trump : Go ahead.

Question : Mr. President, what do you think about the UK getting into business with China? Keir Starmer was in Beijing.

Trump : Well, it's very dangerous for them to do that, and it's even more dangerous, I think, for Canada to get into business with China. Canada's not doing well. Uh, they're doing very poorly. And then you can't look at China as the answer. That's, I know China very well. I know President Xi is a friend of mine. I know him very well, but that's a, that's a big hurdle to go over when you get Canada. The first thing they're gonna do is say, "You're not allowed to play ice hockey anymore." That's not good. Canada's not gonna like.

Question : About, on Iran, Mr. President --

Question : Mr. President, Mr. President, The Fed yesterday voted 10 to 2, to pause interest rates. Do you think the problem with The Fed is more than just Jerome Powell?

Trump : When you have other political people on The Fed, absolutely. You have political people that will vote against Trump or an, a re- -- a Republican, but in particular, Trump. But we've done so well with the economy, you see the numbers. We're getting the best numbers that we've ever had as a country, and that's despite the fighting. Uh, we've broken the, The Fed wall. I mean, they, they could, they could have been much better. It could have been much more helpful to the country. But even despite the little bit higher interest rates, you notice that the interest rates now are falling despite The Fed. But I'm gonna be announcing, I think, a really great choice tomorrow. I'm very excited about it, and I'll be announcing it tomorrow morning.

Question : For all those Fed governors who wanted to pause interest rates, do you think they'll have their mind changed when there's a new Fed chairman on board?

Trump : I do. Yeah, I think they will do.
