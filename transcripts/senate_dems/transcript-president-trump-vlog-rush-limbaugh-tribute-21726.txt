President Trump: Well, this is the fifth anniversary of the loss of a really great man, a great conservative, somebody that loved our country, loved his family, loved a lot of things. But he was a friend of mine. Rush Limbaugh. I'd never met Rush when I announced that I was running. I'll never forget, 2015, and I got a call, all excited, that Rush Limbaugh just endorsed you. I never met him. He liked my opening speech. He liked, uh, when I get up in June, and I said, you know, we got bad borders, we got bad crime, we got bad everything, and he liked it. I came down the escalator with, now, our first lady, and he thought it was great, and he endorsed me. And then I got to know him, and I realized what a great guy he was. But, it's five years that we miss Rush. As Sean Hannity would often say, there will never be another Rush Limbaugh. So to his family, his great wife and family, I just want to say, we miss you all, we miss him, and there'll never be anybody like him. Thank you very much.
