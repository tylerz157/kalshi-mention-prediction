================================================================================

President Donald Trump : This is the big day. We have a big day. Uh, one of the biggest that's celebrating our Navy and our military. We have the greatest military anywhere in the world, not even close, as you've probably noted. And we rebuilt it largely during my first term. And now I guess we'll see it in action. So, we're gonna a great big day today. It's gonna be very exciting.

Question: Mr. Trump, [Inaudible] and you [Inaudible] for [Inaudible] year. Would you like to do that?

Trump: Said what?

Question: President Putin offered [Inaudible] for nuclear arms for one more year to then [Inaudible] do that?

Trump: Sounds like -- sounds like a good idea to me.

Question: Mr. President, will you follow the Palestinian Authority, may concern that with the day after [Inaudible]. Now can you please explain to me, what is the purpose by doing this if [Inaudible] Israel, they are paying to terrorists, they're paying salary to terrorist.

Trump: Who are you with?

Question: [Inaudible] Israel. My name is [Inaudible].

Trump: Well, it's a great deal for Israel, and it's a great deal for everybody. And you want to get your hostages back, right? You want them back, or do you not want them back?

Question: Of course. And, uh, it's a great deal for Israel. It's a great deal for the entire Arab world, and the world. And we're very happy about that. Mr. President, when do you think the hostage [Inaudible]?

Trump: I think very soon. We're, uh, we're in negotiations right now as we speak. Uh, they've started the negotiation. They're going to last a couple of days. We'll see how it turns out. But I'm hearing it's going very well.

Question: Mr. President, [Inaudible]

Trump: We want to fix it so it works. It's not working. Obamacare has been a disaster for the people, so we wanna have it fixed, so it works.

Question: Mr. President, will you follow the executive order in Portland [Inaudible]

Trump: Uh, we're gonna look at that. It was amazing. Uh, Portland is burning to the ground. It's, uh, insurrection is all over the place. It's Antifa, and yet the politicians who are petrified -- look, the politicians are afraid for their lives. That's the only reason that they say like they're nothing happening. And you've seen it. The place is burning down, and they pretend like there's nothing happening. So we'll take a look at the order. We haven't seen the order yet.

Question: Mr. President, you're going to celebrate the Navy today. The Navy is deployed in the Caribbean against the cartels. What is the next step on this war against drug trafficking in South America?

Trump: Well, we're gonna stop drug trafficking, and we've done a lot. There's nobody, there's nobody coming in on the water, that I can tell you. The water is like, there's nobody. There's no drugs coming in on the water. And we'll take a look at what phase two is. Made -- made a big difference.

Question: [Inaudible] flexibility on the Hamas plan?

Trump: We have, uh, very little. We don't need flexibility, 'cause everybody's pretty much agreed to it. But there'll always be some changes. But the Hamas plan, I tell you, it's amazing. You're gonna have peace. If you think about it, peace in the Middle East for the first time in, they say, really 3,000 years.

Trump: So I'm very honored to be a big part of that. Look, uh, they've been fighting for a plan for years. We get the hostages back almost immediately. Negotiations are going on right now. We'll probably take a couple of days, and people are very happy about it.

Question: [Inaudible] government shut down [Inaudible]. Our government shut down. Would you --

Trump: Go ahead. Go ahead.

Question: -- support [Inaudible]?

Trump: Say it?

Question: [Inaudible] what's your reaction?

Trump: Well, I disagree with that judge. I wasn't served well. If they'd put judges like that on. I wasn't served well by the people that pick judges, I can tell you. Uh, things like that are just too bad. I appointed the judge, and it goes like that. So, I wasn't served well. Obviously, I don't know the judge. But, uh, if he made that kind of a decision -- Portland is burning to the ground. You have agitators, insurrectionist, all you have to do is look at the -- look at the television, turn on your television, read your newspapers. It's burning to the ground. The governor, the mayor, the politicians are petrified for their lives.

Question: Mr. President --

Trump: And you have a judge like that. He ought to be a --

Question: [Inaudible] Mr. President --

Trump: That judge ought to be ashamed of himself.

Question: A governor -- You say they're targeting the worse of the worst. But Governor Christopher said that most of the people ICE has taken in his state have no criminal history. No criminal convictions. So, which is it?

Trump: He's wrong. Number one, he's wrong. Number two, I really believe he's afraid for his life, somehow. When you can have 40 or 50 people killed over the last couple of months, hundreds of people wounded, there's no place like that in the world. Hundreds of people wounded. 50, 55 people shot and killed. And Pritzker gets up and says what a wonderful place it is. They need help. Washington D.C. Is now a safe place. You're not gonna get mugged or hit. You're not gonna get raped, you're not gonna get anything. Washington D.C. Went from a hellhole to a safe place. I love the way you nod. Is it true though? I mean, people -- A lot of the people right here were -- Wait. A lot of the people right here were mugged. Reporters. And you know what? You're safe now. Nothing -- We got no crime. It took 12 days to solve the problem. 12 days.

Question: Back up here --

Trump: And we're gonna do that in Chicago. We're gonna do that in Portland. Now, Portland is different. That's a bunch of paid insurrectionists. But you have a lot of paid people in Chicago too. Do I believe the politicians are under threat, because there's no way somebody can say that things are wonderful in Chicago. Almost 55, I think it was, 55 people over a short period of time have been murdered in Chicago, have been shot. 222 people over a short period of time have been hit, have been wounded. Not died, but 55 people died over a short period of time, and you're telling me -- There's no city in the world like that. We're gonna straighten it out. And I think that Pritzker, he's not a stupid person. I think that Pritzker's afraid for his life.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Trump: You wanna make it better.

Question: What about the layoffs? [Inaudible]

Trump: Well, the Dem- -- I call 'em Democrat layoffs. They're Democrat layoffs. Uh, they're causing it. We're ready to go back. You know, we have a record-setting economy. We have a record-setting country. Prices are way down. We're doing better than the country has ever done. And the Democrats hate seeing that. It's up to them. Uh, anybody laid off, that's because of the Democrats. Thank you.

Question: [Inaudible] deadline?

Trump: Okay, let's go. Thank you.

Question: Thank you.
