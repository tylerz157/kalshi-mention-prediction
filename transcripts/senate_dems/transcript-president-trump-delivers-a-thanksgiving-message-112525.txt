President Trump : On behalf of the First Lady and the entire Trump family, I want to wish all Americans a very, very happy Thanksgiving. It's a great time of the year, and our country is doing really well, economically, like we've never done before.

Today we continue a time-honored American tradition. In a few moments, I will grant a full, absolute, and unconditional presidential pardon to two handsome Thanksgiving turkeys. And this is their lucky day. This is a lucky day for them.

I hope all Americans will have the chance to enjoy the fellowship of family and friends and renew our faith in God's providence. And now let's go and give gobble.

You are pardoned. Gobble. I just want to tell you this very important. You are hereby unconditionally pardoned.

Unidentified : So, praise the Lord.

Trump : Praise the Lord [Inaudible]

Unidentified : Yeah.
