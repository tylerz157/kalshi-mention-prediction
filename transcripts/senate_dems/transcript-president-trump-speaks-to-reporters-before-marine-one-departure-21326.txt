================================================================================

President Trump: So we just had very good financial numbers, we have very low inflation, we brought costs way down and the numbers were surprising, except to me they weren't surprising. So the inflation numbers just announced, as you know, are way down and we have it back on track. We had the worst inflation in the history of our country. And now we have very modest inflation which is what you want to have.

Question : Mr. President, why hasn't the FBI taken over the Nancy Guthrie case as the lead investigator? Do you have any updates on how that's going?

Trump: Well, they took it over originally. It was a local case originally and they didn't want to let go of it, which is fine. It's up to them. It's really up to the community. But ultimately when the FBI got involved, I think, you know, progress has been made. Complicated things.

Question : Mt. President, are you anticipating cutting a deal with Democrats to end the potential shutdown for DHS?

Trump : We'll see what happens. We have --

Question : -- President Trump, do you –

Trump : -- we always have to protect our law enforcement, but they've done a great job. Remember, they've taken out hundreds of thousands of criminals out of our country, and we have the best crime numbers we've ever had in everywhere. Murder numbers, crime numbers of any kind. We have the best numbers. We've taken out hundreds of thousands of criminals out of our country. We have to protect our law enforcement.

Question : Mr. President, are you considering land strikes on Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela?

Trump : What about it?

Question : Land strikes -- are you, are you planning --

Trump : -- don't worry about it.

Question : Do you still have a veto on Nouri al-Maliki, the Iraqi prime minister?

Trump : We're looking at a prime minister. We're going to see what's going to happen. We've got some ideas on it. But in the end, everybody needs the US, everybody needs us.

Question : Are you planning to hold anyone accountable for the shutdown in El Paso? The second aircraft carrier that you decided to send. Talk about why you made that choice.

Trump : Well, in case we don't make a deal, we'll need it. If we don't have a deal, we'll need it. If we have a deal, we'd cut it short. It'll be leaving very soon. We have one out there that just arrived. If we need it, we have it ready, a big -- a very big force.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question : Are there any progressing Ukraine negotiations? Do you still demand Zelenskyy has to hold elections before summer?

Trump : Well, Zelenskyy is going to have to get moving. Russia wants to make a deal and Zelenskyy is going to have to get moving, otherwise he's going to miss a great opportunity. He has to move.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question : Mr. President, are you going to hold anyone accountable for El Paso? Mr. President, are you personally involved in these negotiations over DHS funding and where do you see room for compromise?

Trump : Well, but you have to remember, if you look at Homeland Security, if you look at what they've done, if you look at what ICE has done at Border Patrol, we have the safest border in the history of our country. Nobody comes in other than if they come in legally. If you remember just a little while ago, a year-and-a-half ago for a four-year period, they allowed 25 million people in our country.

Many of these people are murderers and drug dealers, a horrible thing. We've gotten a lot of them out. We now have the best record in the history of our country on crime. It was just announced -- it was just announced our crime numbers are the best in 125 years. So I -- I am here to protect law enforcement and law -- our -- our great police and ICE and Border Patrol and everybody. I'm here to protect them because they're protecting us and the job they've done is incredible.

Question : Sir, do you still have confidence -- Do you believe Prime Minister Netanyahu will receive a pardon?

Trump : I do think so, yes.

Question : Do you still have confidence in Kristi Noem, Mr. President, despite the reports of chaos? On El Paso, are you satisfied? President Trump, on Greenland. [Inaudible]

Trump : We have safe borders. We have low crime numbers [Inaudible]

Question : Mr. President, you --

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question : Mr. President --

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question: -- family over the airspace closure over El Paso. Are you pleased with Sean Duffy's handling of the airspace closure over El Paso?

Trump : You mean the way it happened? People learn, you know, people learn.

Question : On Greenland. On European leader's hypocrisy. Greenland doesn't want Europe controlling them anymore. What's your message to them to those European leaders' hypocrisy?

Trump : Well, I think Greenland's going to want us, but we get along very well with Europe. We'll see how it all works out. We're negotiating right now for Greenland.

Question : Mr. President, do you think the cartels -- Mr. President, do you think the cartels are at all involved in Nancy Guthrie's case or another nation-state potentially?

Trump : You can't say that yet, it's a little bit early. But it's -- somebody either knew what they were doing very well or they were rank amateurs. Either way, it's not a good situation.

Question : Mr. President, do you think Sean Duffy should be held accountable? What is your message for European leaders in Munch Security Conference?

Trump : Well, I have a great relationship with them. If it wasn't for me, they'd be paying 2 percent and not paying. Instead, they're paying 5 percent and they're paying. We have a very good relationship with NATO.

Question : Mr. President, how confident are you that our negotiations with Iran will be successful?

Trump : I think they'll be successful. And if they're not, it's going to be a bad day for Iran. Very bad.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question : Mr. President, are you actively talking with the Democrats right now about a DHS shutdown? How painful do you expect that to be?

Trump : We're talking, but, you know, we have to protect law enforcement. ICE has done a phenomenal job. Border Patrol -- we have a shut -- we have a closed border for the first time in history. We have to protect law enforcement, our police, our Border Patrol, ICE, and others in law enforcement. Uh, we -- and I'm very much -- look, I know what they want, I know what they can live with. The Democrats have gone crazy. The radical left lunatics. That's why their cities are so unsafe. The blue cities are the cities that are unsafe. So we have to protect our law enforcement.

Question : Mr. President, you just lifted sanctions on Venezuelan oil. What are the next steps and when are you going to wholesale [Inaudible]

Trump : Well, we have a very good relationship with the president of Venezuela, as you know, we're working together very closely. We have our big oil companies going in. They're going to be taking out the oil and selling the oil for a lot of money and Venezuela is going to get a big part of that money. And the relationship we have right now with Venezuela is, I would say, a 10.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question : Mr. President!

Trump : Look, it's beneficial, we'll feed the people -- the people of Venezuela.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question : Mr. President, when are you -- -- On Venezuela -- on Venezuela, will you be recognizing Delcy Rodriguez's government as the official government of Venezuela?

Trump : Well, right now, we have got that. We're dealing with them. And really -- and really right now they've done a great job. She's done -- Delcy's done a very, very good job and the relationship is strong. The oil is coming out and a lot of money is being paid for oil by other nations and we're taking care of it. We're refining it and we're the only one that has the capability to refine it. Right now, the relationship with Venezuela is as good as it can possibly be.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question : When are you planning to visit Venezuela? When are you planning to visit Venezuela, sir?

Trump : I'm going to make a visit to Venezuela.

Question : When? When?

Trump : We haven't decided. Are you from Venezuela?

Question : From Colombia, sir. We share a border with Venezuela. Mr. President!

Trump : We just had a good meeting with your president.

Question : The president of Colombia, yeah. Mr. President, on the Munich Security Conference. What is your message to Europe and to the leaders?

Trump : I think the -- the only message is we have a great relationship with NATO. We're a very powerful part of NATO. The people that are the heads of the countries, the various countries that we're talking about, they're all friends of mine.

Question : Mr. President --

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question : -- of the meeting with the President of Colombia? Mr. President. Will you let Congress back in town? Will you meet with the North Korean Kim Jong Un this year? Kim Jong Un? Mr. President, do you have a deadline? Mr. President, do you have a deadline for Iran? Do you have any deadline for Iran?

Trump : Kinda do, yeah.

Question : Mr. President, the FBI investigation -- Thank you. Mr. President, Rwanda just violated the peace agreement. What are you going to do about it? You told me last time that there will be consequences. They continue to kill a lot of Congolese people in -- in DRC.

Trump : We'll take a look at it. We'll --

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question : -- the shutdown, Mr. President? Are you happy with the current situation in Syria after the deal that you brokered?

Trump : The president is doing a very good job. He's unifying the country. We're very happy with the job he's doing. He's doing a great job for the people of Syria. He's unifying the country. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Question : Mr. President. Have you -- have you spoken with

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question : I want to show you the evidence.

Trump : Hello, Brian. Let's go.

Question: You're going to do it. Hey, step back. Oh my God. Mr. President. First of all, pretty strong economic numbers going into '26, stock market 50,000. You said it could go to 100,000 plus.

Trump : And these numbers today are on inflation.

Question: Yeah, I was going to say what's the outlook for the remainder of '26 do you think?

Trump : I think we're going to have 100,000 by the time I leave office and at the end of my term. Uh, I think we're going to be at 100,000 the Dow. And if you remember when I was first elected, everybody said, if I got it to 50,000, the Dow, or 7,000 with the S&P, if I got it to 50,000 with a Dow, that would be an amazing -- that would be in four years from then, from the election.

I got it in 50,000 the last day of my first year. So I'm about, uh, I'm pretty early. I think we have a great chance of doing very substantially higher numbers. The country is doing well. We have the hottest country anywhere in the world, by far, and the inflation numbers that just came out moments ago were actually incredible. Prices are way down, inflation is way down, far lower than anyone thought could have happened in a period of one year.

Question: Mr. President! Mr. President! Mr. President! Mr. President, I have evidence to show you! I have a lot to show you.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question : -- shut down. Mr. President. Are there any concessions you're willing to make with ICE, about ICE or about immigration enforcement?

Trump : It's favor of our law enforcement, ICE has done an amazing job. We've taken up hundreds of thousands of horrible criminals, including murderers. We had 11,888 murderers. A lot of them have been found and removed from our country. We have the lowest crime numbers. We have the best crime numbers we've had.

You won't believe this one, 125 years. From the year 1900, we have the best crime numbers that we've had in 125 years. I have a great loyalty to ICE, the Border Patrol, to our police, to, frankly, our firemen etc. Thank you.

Question : [Inaudible] Has the economy turned a corner?

Trump : Well, I think so. We're at 50,000 and we're at 7,000 with S&P. And if you remember, and they can say it any way they want, they said if Trump, by the end of his term, four years, would get the number of Dow -- the Dow down number to 50,000, it would be a miracle. I got it in one year to 50,000. Think of it, in one year. And I got S&P, which is actually harder, to 7,000, which they said would be impossible to do even within four years and I got it in one year.

Question : Do you think -- do you think Democrats -- do you think Democrats --

Trump : Because the economy -- the economy is doing unbelievable. We, right now, have the hottest country anywhere in the world.

Question : Mr. President. So do you think the Democrats [Inaudible] Thank you, Mr. President.
