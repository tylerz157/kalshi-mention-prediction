President Trump : After many years of decline in our air traffic control system, the one big beautiful bill will modernize this decrepit relic and give America the best, most advanced air traffic control system on Earth. The best by far. It contains a historic program to update antiquated communications and radar systems, deteriorating hardware, and ancient software. This is really old stuff. It's ancient, with the latest 21st century tools and equipment. It will improve runway safety and build new air traffic control centers for the first time in more than 50 years, and keep America flying safely and efficiently for decades to come. Many, many decades are going to go by before this one gets obsolete. It's the best in the world. It's time to pass the one big beautiful bill into law. We're going to get it done. We're going to take care of air traffic control. Thank you very much.
