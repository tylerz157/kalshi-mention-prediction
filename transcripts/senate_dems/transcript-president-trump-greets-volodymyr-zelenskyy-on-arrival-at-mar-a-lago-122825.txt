================================================================================

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy: Oh, it's great.

President Trump: How are you doing? Se

Zelenskyy: Good to see you.

Trump: [Inaudible] picture [Inaudible]

Question: Mr. President, do you think Putin is serious about peace this time?

Trump: I do. I do. I think he is. I think they both are.

Question: [Inaudible]

Trump: Got to make a deal. Got to get it done. Too many people dying. And I think both presidents want to make a deal. We believe that. I'm going to brief you on my call [Inaudible]

Question: [Inaudible]

Trump: Depends. It depends. I do believe that we have the makings of a deal that's good for Ukraine, good for everybody. I think very important. There's nothing more important in my book. We settled eight wars but this is the most difficult one. It will be in the middle of the pack. This is the most difficult one, but we're going to get it done. We're going to have a great meeting today and this gentleman has worked very hard and he's very brave. And his people are very brave, but they've gone through [Inaudible], very rarely has a nation ever had to go through. So we're going to have a very good meeting today, I think, and I'm also calling President Putin back after the meeting and we'll continue negotiations. Pretty complex but not that complex.

Question: Can you meet a New Year's day deadline?

Trump: I don't have deadlines. I have -- you know what my deadline is, getting the war ended. We don't have deadlines. Do you agree with that?

Zelenskyy: [Inaudible]

Question: [Inaudible]

Trump: It depends what the security [Inaudible] what a dumb question. Nobody even knows about the security agreement was going to say, but there will be a security agreement. It'll be a strong agreement. And the European nations are very much involved in that. They'll be very much involved in protection, etc. But the European nations have been really great. They're very much in line with this meeting and getting a deal done. They are all -- they're terrific people. I think you can say that. There's no -- nobody bad. They all want to get it done and been very supportive, I think. [Inaudible] do you have anything to say?

Zelenskyy: Thank you so much. Thank you for this meeting. Thank you for [Inaudible] Yes, really, [Inaudible] our teams do what they can and I think that during the last month, they move forward with negotiations and [Inaudible] and they work very hard. They work on different documents. I hope that all these countries can bring peace as quick as possible and I agree with president that the Europeans [Inaudible] and the president is in contact with them. And maybe [Inaudible]

Trump: We could call them today.

Zelenskyy: Yeah [Inaudible] today.

Question: What made you want to come in person to meet the president today?

Zelenskyy: Sorry?

Question: What made you want to come to Mar a Lago to meet the president today?

Zelenskyy: [Inaudible]

Question: Why -- why --

Zelenskyy: Why? So we have amongst our teams, they work [Inaudible] then they work on prosperity and security [Inaudible] is very important we have to discuss, and sequencing. Very important our teams talk about strategy, how to maximize them and to bring this closer and we will discuss this strategy.

Question: Mr. President [Inaudible] territorial concessions?

Zelenskyy: [Inaudible] plan. There is -- they are there in 20 points plan. 90 percent, by the way, was done by our two teams. I think they made a great job, great work and yes, we will discuss these points also.

Trump: And there are great economic benefits for Ukraine also. It's another -- a lot of rebuilding to do. There's a lot of wealth to be had and they have great wealth. Potentially, they have great wealth. They want to get started, but there's a great economic benefit for Ukraine in what we're talking about.

Question: President Trump, some are saying that the recent attacks in the past couple days say Russia staged against Ukraine shows that President Putin isn't serious about peace. What is your reaction to that?

Trump: No, he's very serious. I think I can say that I believe Ukraine has made some very strong attacks also. And I don't say that negatively. I think you probably have to. I wouldn't say they're negative [Inaudible] but I think -- he hasn't told me that, but there have been some explosions in various parts of Russia. And it looks to me like, I don't know, I don't think it came from the Congo. I don't think it came from the United States of America. It possibly came from Ukraine, but I haven't asked that question. Maybe I won't bother asking. No, they have -- they're fighting a war and we'll see what happens. But I believe it's a war that we have two willing parties, we have two willing countries, they want to see it end, with the people of Ukraine want it to end and the people of Russia want it and the two leaders want it to end.

Question: Mr. President, on the economic benefits for Ukraine, Europe is holding some billions in frozen assets. Do you believe that should go to Ukraine to help rebuild or go back to Russia?

Trump: None of that's been determined, but it will go -- it's going to go very quickly. I think we're very -- we're in final stages of talking and we're going to see. Otherwise, it's going to go on for a long time. It'll either end or it's going to go on for a long time and millions of additional people are going to be killed, millions, and nobody wants that.

Question: Are you still frustrated -- -- get to an agreement today -- When you say that you think it will either end or go on for a long time, [Inaudible] what are you expecting --

Trump: I just think we can do -- I think we can move very rapidly. I feel that. We've spoken. I know you had dinner with Steve. Steve Witkoff and Jared have done a fantastic job. And everybody has. Marco has been incredible. The whole group has been -- our group has been incredible and Ukraine appreciates it and Russia appreciates it. They both want to see it end and we're going to get it ended. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.

Zelenskyy: Thank you so much.

Trump: We'll see you, I think, in the end, but I do think we'll call Europe also. We're going to speak to the European leaders.

Zelenskyy: Yes.

Trump: Thank you very much.
