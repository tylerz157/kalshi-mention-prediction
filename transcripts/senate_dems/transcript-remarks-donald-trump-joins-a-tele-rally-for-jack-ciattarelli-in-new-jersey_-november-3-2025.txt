================================================================================

Donald Trump: Well, thank you very much Jeff and I want to thank you maybe more importantly, for doing such a great job as a congressman. We've fought together to stop all those hundreds of windmills they wanted to build off the Jersey Shore and we stopped it, you and I and a couple of other people. There weren't too many that helped us. And I just want to congratulate you on that.

It would've been a disaster. Uh, just an absolute disaster. Raise up the cost of energy more and would've been so bad. So I just want to thank Congressman Jeff Van Drew, a special man. And hello to the incredible patriots of the great state of New Jersey. Tomorrow is election day in your state and you need to go out and vote for Jack Ciattarelli, who's a great guy, a friend of mine, a great guy, a very successful man who wants to put all of his efforts now into really saving New Jersey, making it great again, saving it. And, uh, he's gonna do it. He'll be able to do it. The polls are looking really good.

They're just about even. And they say even for us is, uh, a win. You know, it's, uh, if you can be even, that means it's a win. We gotta be very careful, get out and vote, but we have to beat the radical left. The polls will open tomorrow, as you know, 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM. And if you want information, go to SwampTheVoteUSA.com for more information.

You get it, uh, right at that. Just go. Everybody's waiting to give you whatever information you wanna go out and vote for. Jack, Jack Ciattarelli is a businessman and a public servant who has devoted his life to the people of New Jersey. He really has too. He loves to, he loves the state. He's fighting for lower taxes, lower prices, lower cost of living, much of the same things that I'm fighting for and especially lower energy costs.

Your energy costs have gone through the roof under Democrat leadership, even though on a national basis they've gone way down. You're close to $2 for gasoline, $2 a gallon, was up to five at six, and then it was four and 4.50. It's down to close to $2 now. And it's, uh, nobody can believe it, but, you know, drill, baby drill.

That's what I say. And that turned out to be true. But we're, uh, we're at a co- -- at a position where it's incredible. But the Democrats, if they got in -- Your energy costs in New Jersey are very, very high, one of the highest in the nation. And if they get in, it's gonna go, it could double, triple, and even quadruple.

It will not be sustainable. If, uh, Jack gets in and, you know, with what we're doing in Washington and it's not necessarily equal because we can create low energy costs, w- -- which we've done. And yet New Jersey is through the roof. So you figure it. But Jack will get him down and he'll get him down really low.

Calls me about it all the time. Energy is a big factor. You want high energy, vote for the Democrat. If you wanna see really low energy costs, vote for Jackie will deliver safe communities as well for the law-abiding citizens of your state. He's very crime oriented to stop crime. Much more so than almost all politicians, 'cause I deal with all of them.

Fully supports our police. He has the total endorsement of every police, every group in the state he's endorsed by and get the illegal aliens and the criminals and gang members and people from mental institutions that were dropped into our country. He agrees we gotta get 'em out, we're getting them out at record numbers as you probably know.

We have a border that's allowing virtually nobody in, they had a border that allowed 25 million people in, many of them, many of them absolute criminals, drug dealers, drug addicts, people from mental institutions. They emptied our, their jails into our country. And we are getting them

But that's not, it's not about looking good, it's about getting it all done. But we're really a champion for common sense, and that's the Republican Party. So Jack is running against a horrible, fake, corrupt, radical left Democrat opponent named Mikie Sherrill. The only thing she's got going is it's a very unusual name.

I've never heard of the name Mikie, for a woman, but, uh, maybe this will be the last. I don't think too many people will be naming their child after Mikie. Her energy policies would send you prices soaring and make New Jersey even more expensive than it already is, which as I said is one of the, one of the highest in the entire country.

Combined with her high tax or high crime agenda, Mikie Sherrill will send New Jersey into a death spiral, deficit spiral and jobs and businesses are gonna flee the state. And I don't want that to happen 'cause I, as you know, I'm in the state all the time, different locations all over the state. I have property all over the state.

I love the state. And we gotta make it really great again. Taxes are through the roof and again, families are getting, uh, taxed at levels that they've never seen before. Jack is going to get your taxes down. He is going to get your energy costs down and they're gonna go down really tremendously. Mikie Sherrill is a dishonest person, as you know.

She was thrown out of her school for cheating and, uh, didn't want to talk about it, but they found her and she wasn't allowed to walk with her graduating class. She would be a travesty as a governor in New Jersey. Your state has been wrecked by radical left Democrats and lunatics in Trenton for decades. It's been time, uh, for a change a long time ago, but now it is time for a change.

You have a -- this is maybe your finest chance. I don't want to say your last chance because that would be a pretty negative statement, but it's certainly, uh, a great chance. Jack is just about even in some polls even leading, but only leading if you get out and vote. In 2024, my campaign received the most votes for a Republican presidential candidate in the New Jersey history by far.
