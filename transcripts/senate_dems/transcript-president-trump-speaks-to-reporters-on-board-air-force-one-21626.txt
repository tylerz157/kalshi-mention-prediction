================================================================================

Question : Hey, sir.

President Trump : Hello, Steve.

Question : Thanks for your presence today.

Trump : Hello, everybody.

Question : Happy President's Day, Mr. President.

Trump : So, uh, great financial numbers you saw. Low inflation, very low inflation. Prices are down, way down. Um, gasoline is less than $2 in many places gallon, which nobody expected to see, but I did is we're going by the initial expression of drill, baby drill and prices are coming down very strongly and as goes gasoline and oil and gas, uh, so goes the rest of, uh, other products that were high because of Biden.

So we inherited a mess and we've, uh, brought our country back very, very powerfully. Uh, crime numbers are way down, despite the fact that they let in 25 million people, many of whom should not have been allowed into our country with their open border policy. But it's, uh, the country's doing very well. Any questions?

Question : What are you expecting from these Iran talks in Geneva tomorrow?

Trump : So I'll be, uh, involved in those talks indirectly, and they'll be very important. We'll see what can happen. But typically Iran's a very tough negotiator, they're good negotiators or bad, I would say they're bad negotiators because we could add a deal instead of sending the B-2s into knock out their nuclear potential and we had to send the B-2s. I hope, uh, I hope they're gonna be more reasonable. They wanna make a deal.

Question : Have you been told that a deal is next to impossible?

Trump: No, no. I think they wanna make a deal. I don't think they, uh, want the consequences of not making a deal. They wanna make a deal.

Question : You going to sit down with Democrats this week on DHS funding, sir?

Trump : I will. But you know, we have to protect our law enforcement. They've done a great job. I just got finished saying that we have the best crime numbers we've had in many years and on murders 125 years. And that's despite a lot of people that shouldn't have been led into our country coming into our country.

Criminals, many, many criminals. But we've taken out tens of thousands of people, brought 'em back to their countries. Uh, many of the criminals that were brought in allowed to come in, have been removed. So, you know, we're okay. But to have the best crime numbers, which aren't made by me, these are made by people that do that, many left-leaning.

We have the best murder numbers. Horrible thing to say. But we have the best murder numbers since 1900. That's before my father was born. 125 years, think of it. The best crime number since 1900, having to do with murder and really good crime numbers. The best in years.

Question : Are there any demands that Democrats are making that you're okay with? Uh, to, to get --

Trump : Well, I don't like some of the things they're asking for. We're gonna protect law enforcement. We're gonna protect ICE. You know, they're part of the whole system that is working. I mean, Washington, D.C now is considered a very safe city. When I took over, it was a, a city that you were losing two, three people a week. Over a hundred people a year were being murdered in Washington. Now, it's considered a very safe city.

Question : Mr. President --

Trump : And we did that. I did it over a fairly short period of time too.

Question : On DHS, uh, recent news reports have discussed the widespread belief that Kristi Noem and Corey Lewandowski are in a per- -- personal relationship. Is that a bad look?

Trump : Up.

Question : Uh, recent news reports have discussed the, the possibility that Kristi Noem and Corey Lewandowski are in a close personal relationship. Is that a bad look? And do you think she'll be in the job much longer?

Trump : I don't know about that. I mean, I haven't heard that. Uh, I'll find out about it, but I have not heard.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Question : Will you give your State of the Union speech if we're still in a shutdown next week?

Trump : Well, I think I would. Wouldn't bother me. I would give. Yep.

Question : How are the negotiations going?

Trump : With what, which one? We have a lot of negotiations.

Question : No, with the government shutdown.

Trump : Uh, this is a Democrat shutdown. This has nothing to do with Republicans.

Question : What has the --

Trump : This is a Democrat shutdown.

Question : What has the White House --

Trump : They're upset that the crime numbers are so good. They're very unhappy that the crime numbers are so good. They're very unhappy that there's a movement for get, getting voter ID. They want voter ID. The population 98% want voter ID. They don't want voter ID 'cause they wanna cheat on elections. Uh, they also want other things. They don't want mail-in ballots. They wanna end mail-in ballots, which is corrupt. And one other thing that they're insisting on is proof of citizenship. And the Democrats don't want to give proof of citizenship. They don't want to give voter ID. Think of it, who wouldn't want proof of citizenship? I ask you, Steve, who wouldn't want voter ID? And why would you want mail-in ballots if you know it's corrupt?

It's a corrupt system. We're the only country in the world that has this system of mail-in ballots. You think of it, the only country in the world that has this system with mail-in ballots 'cause they cheat. And the fact is, they could never get elected if they ever changed. They know it. If you had voter ID, if you had proof of citizenship, they could never win an election. And they know that. And they're fighting to the, to the hilt. And I put this down with men playing in women's sports. I put it down with transgender for everybody. I put it down with their horrible open border policy as being ridiculous. They don't want voter ID. No voter ID. And I put that down in the same category with men playing in women's sports. I'm gonna add a fourth category. They don't want voter ID. Go ahead.

Question : So, so Hillary Clinton said in an interview today that she and her husband are getting pulled into the Epstein matter to divert attention from you and that your administration has something to hide. What's your response?

Trump : I have nothing to hide. I've been exonerated. I have nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein. They went in hoping that they'd find it and found just the opposite. I've been totally exonerated. And in fact, Jeffrey Epstein was fighting that I don't get elected with some author, a sleazebag, by the way. And, uh, I've been totally exonerated. No, no, no, they're getting pulled in and that's their problem. I don't know. They got to see what happens, but I watched her in Munich, and she seriously has Trump derangement syndrome.

Question : Do you think that she should publicly testify?

Trump : You know, I've been totally exonerated on Epstein, and it's really interesting because they've been pulled in. Think of it, they've been pulled in, Clinton and, and many other Democrats have been pulled in. Yeah.

Question : US-Australia border, just rinsing from the Caribbean to the Middle East, is about to hit into eight-month deployment mark. Usually, they're deployed for about six months or so. Is there any concern that US carriers are being stretched too thin?

Trump : It's, I'll answer the question last.

Question : Mr. President, you're warning Cuba to make a deal. Uh, what does that deal look like? What do you want them to --

Trump : Make a deal. Cuba is right now a failed nation. Uh, they don't even have jet fuel to get, for airplanes to take off. They're logging up their runway. But we're talking to Cuba right now. They have Marco Rubio talking to Cuba right now, and they should absolutely make a deal because it's a human, it's really a humanitarian threat and we have a lot of great Cuban-Americans and, uh, they're gonna be very happy when they're gonna be able to go back and say hello to their relatives and do things that they should have been allowed to do for a long time. I'm very interested in the people that are here, that were treated so badly by Castro and the Cuban authorities. They have been treated horribly. So, we'll see how it all turns out. But Cuba and us, we are talking.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Trump : In the meantime, there's an embargo. There's no oil. There's no money. There's no anything.

Question : If a deal isn't made, would you consider an operation like the one in Venezuela?

Trump : I don't wanna answer that. Why would I answer that? If I, if I was, it wouldn't be a very tough operation as you can figure, but I don't think that'll be necessary.

Question : Mr. President, Marco Rubio received really positive reviews in Munich. Is there --

Trump : Very good reviews.

Question : Is there a scenario in which you would support him at the top of the ticket in '28?

Trump : Something I don't have to worry about now. I've got three years to go, so it's something I don't have to worry. JG's fantastic, and Marco's, they're both fantastic, I think, really, and I think Marco did a great job at Munich.

Question : President Xi and your talk with him recently, uh, uh, it warned about sending more weapons to Taiwan. What was your response then? Are you gonna send more weapons to Taiwan --

Trump : Response, I have a response. I'm talking to him about it. We had a good conversation and uh, we'll make a determination pretty soon.

Question : Tell us about your trip to --

Trump : We have a very good relationship with President Xi.

Question : Tell us about --

Trump : In fact, I'll be going, I guess, in April.

Question : I'm sorry. Tell us about your trip to Rome, Georgia on Thursday, your trip to Marjorie Taylor Green's old district.

Trump : Well, we have a lot of people that wanna take Marjorie Taylor, Greene's place and, uh, many, many candidates and I have to choose one. And they say whoever I endorse is gonna win, but we have a lot of good candidates wanna take our place.

Question : So, your Court of Peace meets for the first time this week, you said it could be the most consequential international organization ever. That's a high bar. What do you want for this first meeting?

Trump : Well, I think it can be. We're gonna have all world leaders. They're putting up tremendous amounts of money, and I think it's gonna go far beyond Gaza, and I think it'll be peace all over the world. And we're working in conjunction with the United Nations. If the United Nations is there, they haven't lived up to do potential. United Nations has great potential. They haven't lived up to the potential, but I think they might hate us a little bit. But we have the greatest leaders in the world joining the Board of Peace. And we'll be doing it in conjunction with, in some cases, the United Nations, and see if we can get the United Nations to get on the ball.

Question : Mr. President, you have been a kingmaker in a lot of Republican primaries, a lot of people --

Trump : Including foreign nations. I was very honored to see that. A very wonderful prime minister in Japan won by a landslide. I think she was gonna win, but she won by just about the biggest vote ever in Japan, and she attributed my endorsement for that, and that's very good 'cause we have a great relationship with her and Japan.

Question : A lot of Republicans in DC are asking you to endorse John Cornyn, but you haven't yet. Is is there a chance you wouldn't endorse Paxton? And why haven't you endorsed Cornyn?

Trump : I just haven't made a decision on that race yet. It's got a ways to go and I haven't, he's a good man. John is a good, I like all three of 'em, actually. I like all three. So, those are the toughest races. They've all supported me. They're all good. And you're supposed to pick one, so we'll see what happens. But I, I support all three.

Question : -- not involved in the rift between UAE and Saudi Arabia?

Trump : No, I'm not. I would be.

Question : What do you think of that? Somebody --

Trump : I would be. Well, I can settle it very easily, but they have a, uh, they do indeed have a rift and we can get it settled very easily. I settle wars. I settle a lot of rifts between countries. You've been noticing, right? That's an easy one to settle.

Question : On Venezuela, Nancy Rodriguez last week said that Nicolas Maduro is still a legitimate resident and is innocent. I know you said the relationship is a 10, but I'm curious, what's your thoughts on that?

Trump : I think we have a great relationship. I think she probably has to say that. I think politically, maybe she has to say that. Uh, but, uh, the relationship with Venezuela, well, she's doing a very good job, and I fully understand that statement.

Question : You're, you're gonna have uh, Ukraine talk tomorrow as well in Geneva with Witkoff and Jared Kushner.

Trump : Yeah.

Question : What are you expecting there? Is there --

Trump : Well, we're big talks. It's gonna be, uh, very easy. I mean, it's, look so far, Ukraine better come to the table fast, it's all I'm telling you. Uh, we are in a position, we want them to come. And by the way, I watched AOC answering questions in Munich. This was not a good look with the United States. I watched Gavin Newsom answering questions for, in Gene- -- in, uh, Munich. And this was a bad look for our country. This was a bad, these two people are incompetent.

It's all I'm telling you. Uh, we are in a position, we want them to come. And by the way, I watched AOC answering questions in Munich. This was not a good look with the United States. I watched Gavin Newsom answering questions for, in Gene- -- in, uh, Munich. And this was a bad look for our country. This was a bad, these two people are incompetent. And at least Hillary's competent. She's just Trump deranged. She was so deranged. I just, she is an angry woman. But I watched the other two speaking and answering basic questions. Look, Gavin is, destroyed California. And AOC, I never really got her to, I never heard her speak very much. And they started answering questions.

She had no idea what was happening. She had no idea how to answer, you know, very important questions concerning the world. But she can't answer questions concerning New York City either. Because New York City is, got some problems.

Question : Now that Gaza's entering in phase two, should Israel lift its ban on foreign journalists being allowed into Gaza?

Trump : Well, we'll be, uh, lifting a lot of bans pretty soon. I think you're gonna see everything opening up. Gaza, look, we have peace in the Middle East. Now, you have some flames here and there. But we essentially have peace in the Middle East. And that happened primarily when we did the B-2 attack on the nuclear potential nuclear power. They would've had a nuclear weapon within one month. If that happened, it would've been a whole different deal. Okay, thank you very much everybody. Thanks.

Question : One more thing. So the, the five billion that you announced yesterday for the Board of Peace, is that a down payment or are you expecting more?

Trump : No, we wanna help people. That's peanuts compared to the kind of money that has been spent in the Middle East by Bush, by Obama, by all of these people, by Biden. I mean the money he spent. But the money he's made, you know, that's such a small amount of money like the Pharisee. But, uh, we wanna make it successful. I think it has the chance to be the most consequential board ever assembled of any kind. Thank you.

Question : How was golf for Ron DeSantis?

Trump : Great. We had a great time. We had Ron and a couple of other people, two great coaches as you know, the two greatest coaches, I would say, certainly at college football. And, uh, we had a good time playing golf. Thank you very much.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Trump : I didn't get to play today because I'm working on other things. Very important things. Much more important than golf. Thank you very much.

Question : -- Melania for Valentine's, Mr. President?

Trump : She's on the plane. She's, Melania's in the, we have a movie star on the plane.

Question : Did you have any Valentine's Day plans with her?

Trump : Did I what?

Question : Did you do anything for Valentine's with her? Did you give her flowers?

Trump : I better not tell you that. Goodbye, everybody. That's the toughest question. Uh, no, she's very, uh, I'm proud of the fact, you know, her movie, so success, it's a tremendous hit. And, uh, she does a good job. She does, uh, very consequential work. I think you're gonna see in the end that she's gonna go down as one of the truly great first ladies. When you see what she's doing with Russia, Ukraine, and so many of the other things she's doing, she's done a good job. She works very hard.

Question : Okay. Was Wes Moore invited to the White House this week, Mr. President?

Trump : Just so you understand, the governors were all, other than two. One was Colorado where he's got a 73-year-old woman who's probably got serious cancer, confined. And for some time, it's solitary confinement because she pointed out the voter theft that was taking place. In other words, she pointed it out.

They arrested her and they gave her a nine-year sentence, and he better let her go because it's a disgrace. And the other guy's just a bad governor. He's not doing a good job. Wes Moore, he's doing a terrible job.

Question : So he's not invited?

Trump : And you can see that. Well, I, I didn't invite those two. If the rest of them don't wanna show up, that's okay. I hear they're coming, a lot of them. The White House is a great place to be. But no, I, I don't like the job that Wes Moore's doing. I don't like the job he's doing at the Bridge. I don't like the fact that he did that horrible, you know, with the pipes and the Potomac. And, uh, he's not doing the job. They gotta do it. And we're gonna, I'm gonna have to get the federal government involved in getting it fixed because he can't fix anything. Thank you very much.

Question : Thank you, Mr. President.
