I know that you are increasing your military capacity very substantially, and we've received your orders for a very large amount of new military equipment. And you know that we make the best military equipment in the world, the jets, the missiles and everything else. And hopefully we don't have to use them very much, if at all. But, we appreciate that order. And we very much appreciate the trade. We're going to do tremendous trade together. I think more than ever before. We're just signing a new deal, and it's a very fair deal, and we look forward to welcoming Japan into the United States and a continuation. And it's something that everybody is very, very excited about.
