Mark Carney: Thank you, my friend.

Gianni Infantino: You can go --

Carney : Go behind?

Infantino : Behind, yes. Y ahora, la presidenta de México, Sheinbaum:.

Claudia Sheinbaum : Thank you, again.

Infantino: Buenas noches. Por favor, al lado del primer. And now, the 45th and 47th President of the United States, Mr. Donald J. Trump. Mr. President, this way, this way. Or this way. You can do what you want. This is your place.

President Trump : OK.

Infantino : So this is the World Cup trophy. This is the official bowl for the World Cup and we are now going to do the draw, ladies and gentlemen. But before that, as is customary, there is always a question that the moderator asks the draw assistant. So I would like to start with Mr. Carney. How big a deal is it to co-host the World Cup for Canada? Difficult question, I know, but.

Carney : It is the biggest of deals, Gianni. You know, it's the number one sport for Canadian boys and girls. Two thirds of the country watched the last World Cup and we are partnered with the United States and Mexico, welcoming the world. There's more than 200 nationalities in Canada, more than 200 nationalities in FIFA. The top 48 are coming to North America. It is going to be the biggest deal ever.

Infantino: Fantastic. Thank you so much. [?

[? AI Translation: "President Sheinbaum, the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be the biggest sporting event in Mexico's history, making history by becoming the only country to host three editions of the tournament. What does this mean for the Mexican people?"]

Sheinbaum: [? AI Transcription] Orgullosos, orgullosas de recibir por tercera vez la Copa Mundial. México es un país extraordinario, bello, mágico, y millones visitarán nuestra nación. Además, quiero decirles que tenemos un pueblo extraordinario, trabajador, y algo especial: nosotros disfrutamos del juego de pelota desde tiempos ancestrales. [? AI Translation: "We are proud to host the World Cup for the third time. Mexico is an extraordinary, beautiful, and magical country, and millions will visit our nation. I also want to tell you that we have an extraordinary and hardworking people, and something special about us is that we have enjoyed the game of football since ancient times."]

Infantino: [Laughs] [Inaudible] Gracias. Mr. President, President Trump, next summer is historic for the United States in more than one way. What does it mean to you that the FIFA World Cup is actually taking place in the United States, 250th birthday? Special.

Trump : Well, for years, Gianni, they've thought soccer or football would be so big, so fast. And I remember, I shouldn't say this because it was a long time ago, but I remember watching Pele play on a team called the Cosmos, Pele, who was fantastic, as you know. I assume one of the greats.

Infantino : Oh, yes. Pele. Let's applaud Pele, please. One of the greatest.

Trump : And he scored three goals that day. I said, that man can play. That was -- I was pretty young at that point and who knows this -- who knew this was going to happen. But when you look at what has happened to football in the United States, again soccer in the United States, we seem to never call it that because we have a little bit of a conflict with another thing that's called football. But when you think about it, shouldn't it really be called -- I mean, this is football. There's no question about it. We have to come up with another name for the NFL stuff.

Infantino : Yeah, yeah.

Trump : It really doesn't make sense when you think about it. It is really football. But who would have thought it would have come to a level where you've set your all-time season ticket ratings -- nobody's ever sold as many tickets and you're still a long way from that ball being kicked down the field. So I just want to congratulate you. What an incredible leap this has been and congratulations to FIFA.

Infantino : Thank you. Thank you, President. Big round of applause. And the best is still to come, of course. So let's start with the draw. I will -- I will just show you how it works. I've done a few of them. Don't be scared, right? So you have to basically mingle the balls a little bit. You can see. I show this for the public. You see? Mingle. And then one by one, we start with Mr. Carney, you pick one, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. You open it. You see there is a little paper inside. You take out the paper, these two things. You can throw them in here and then you can show to the public what you have drawn, which for me is FIFA, of course.

I'm just the moderator. Mr. Carney, do you want to start? Don't forget and pick the right ball, please. Aha. Already chosen. OK. Let's see which team will be drawn by Mr. Carney:. Oh, Canada. Oh, congratulations. Canada, ladies and gentlemen, the first team drawn in this World Cup Group, B1 for Canada, by the way.

We can continue. [? AI Transcription] Por favor, ¿podemos seguir, Presidenta? Vamos a ver el sorteo más importante del mundo y vamos a ver cuál es el equipo. [? AI Translation: "Please, can we continue, Madam President? We are going to watch the most important draw in the world and we are going to see which team it is."]

Sheinbaum : [? AI Transcription] ¡Viva México! [? AI Translation: "Long live Mexico!"]

Infantino : [? AI Transcription] Felicidades. México, México, Grupo A1, Presidenta. [? AI Translation "Congratulations. Mexico, Mexico, Group A1, President."] President Trump, up to you. Don't forget to mingle, to mix.

Trump : Yeah. I think I know what this is going to be now.

Infantino : Everything.

Trump : But let's see.

Infantino : Are you sure? Are you sure this is the ball? You can still change it if you want?

Trump : Hmm, does he know something that I don't know? Let's give it a shot, Gianni.

Infantino : Let's give it a shot. Let's give it a shot. I agree. OK.

Trump : This is shocking.

Infantino : United States of America. Excellent. Group D1. Can I ask all the three of you to lift like this on your chest, in front of your chest like this? Yeah, the name of the country. We'll get a nice photo. Excellent. And if I can ask you to come in front here for another photo with the paper -- con el papel, por favor. There, here, where you can see the -- voila. Here for another photo, so that everyone can see what you have drawn. Here we are. Thank you very much. Well done. Congratulations. Great assistants. If I may take a selfie with the three of you.

Trump : OK.

Infantino : Come, come. Thank you very much.

Sheinbaum : Thank you. Thank you.

Infantino : Let's go. Thank you.

Trump : OK, Gianni. Thank you.
