President Trump: Well, we just had a great meeting with the oil executives. We've sort of formed a deal. They're gonna be going in with hundreds of billions of dollars and drilling oil. And it's good for Venezuela and it's great for the United States. A lot of money's gonna be made. Oil prices will come down, although they are getting down pretty good now without it. And it was a great meeting we had today with the biggest companies anywhere in the world.

Question: What will happen with the meeting if the President of Colombia doesn't go as planned?

Trump: I think the meeting will go very well with the President of Colombia. I look forward to it.

Question: President Trump, at the National Capital Planning Commission, there were some concerns that this 89,000 square foot structure, same height of this building, is going to dwarf it, overwhelm it. Are you aware about that?

Trump: No. No. It's beautiful. Actually, they had a great meeting yesterday, a really great meeting. And people love it. They love the ballroom. We need it. If we would have had the ballroom today, we could have had all of the oil companies there. We- you know, we don't have the space. So they've needed it for a long time. They've needed the larger buildings. And this ballroom will be the best anywhere in the world. There'll be nothing like it.

Question: What about Venezuela? President Trump? [Inaudible] Venezuela, along with other South American centuries like Venezuela and Brazil, is that place a matter of concern for you because some people that live in South American countries, not only Bolivia, but Columbia, Brazil, there's some help concerns. Is it a matter of concern for you?

Trump: Everyone's going to be happy in South America, everybody. What, what we've done is, some people would say it's a miracle, actually, what we've done. And Venezuela's happy. I think they're all going to be happy. Thank you very much.
