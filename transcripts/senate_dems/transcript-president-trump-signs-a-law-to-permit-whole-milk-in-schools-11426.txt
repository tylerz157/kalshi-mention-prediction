================================================================================

President Trump: OK. Hello, everybody. Thank you very much. You see that beautiful milk, that's what we're here for. We're going to be discussing milk and whole milk and how good it is and how nourishing. And these people all come from beautiful farms. They have a wonderful life and they're happier today than they would have been if we didn't sign this, so we'll be talking about that in a second. Will, could you read the first two items?

Will Scharf: Sure.

Trump : And we're going to get going after that. We'll be talking about a couple of things. We have some news on Iran which we're going to talk about.

Scharf : So shortly before you all came in, the president signed two executive actions. The first is the result of a Section 232 trade investigation into critical minerals supplies. What it does, is it sets up a mechanism, a process by which the United States will seek to secure its international supply chain of critical minerals and critical mineral-derived products.

The second is actually the result of another Section 232 trade investigation, this one into semiconductors. It sets up a two phase process under the first phase, semiconductors that are imported into the United States of America that are not then used domestically to build out our AI or computing architecture here will be subject to a 25 percent tariff.

So for example, semiconductors that were transshipped through the United States to other foreign countries would be subject to that 25 percent tariff. But those are two executive actions that the president reviewed shortly before you -- before you all came in.

So they're going to sell chips, basically. And it's a chip. It's not the highest level, but it's a very good level. And China wants them and other people want them and we're going to be making 25 percent on the sale of those chips, basically. So we're allowing them to do it, but the United States is getting 25 percent of the chips in terms of the dollar value.

And I think it's a very good deal, a great deal. We're taking billions of dollars and they are -- they've done a fantastic job, but it's not the Blackwell or the Ruben. Those are the two top. But it's a very good chip and people want it. And we think it's in our best interest to do. And we have some other little things to talk about.

Maybe we'll start that first. Should I start that first? I think they're going to want me to. I have a feeling they're going to want me to. We have been notified, and pretty strongly, but we'll find out what that all means. But we've been told that the killing in Iran is stopping. It's stopped. It's stopping and there's no plan for executions or execution or executions.

So I've been told that on good authority. We'll find out about it. I'm sure if it happens, we'll all be very upset, including you will be very upset. But that's just gotten to me, some information, that the killing has stopped, that the executions have stopped. They're not going to have an execution, which a lot of people were talking about for the last couple of days.

Today was going to be the day of execution. And another piece of information that I think is very important is the leaker has been found and is in jail right now. And that's the leaker on Venezuela, and a very bad leaker. So there could be some others and we'll let you know about that. We're hot on their trail, but the leaker has been found and the leaker is in jail and will probably be in jail for a long time.

Let's see what happens. So we'll let you know. We'll keep you apprized as to what's going to happen with that. And I want to thank all of the incredible people behind me, political people, both Republicans and Democrats, because they like whole milk. Whether you're a Democrat or a Republican, whole milk is -- right?

Peter Welch: [Inaudible]

Trump : It's a great thing. The Senator was in the office many years ago. It feels like many years ago, but quite a while ago, right at the beginning of my first term.

Welch : Right, with Elijah Cummings.

Trump : Right, with Elijah, very good person. You and I had a good relationship with him. At that time, I think you were a Congressman and you've -- you've made a lot of progress, done very well.

Welch : Some would disagree.

Trump : [Inaudible] I don't -- I think he's done a great job, but it's great -- it's great to have you here again.

Welch : Thank you.

Trump : Appreciate it. So today, I'm delighted to sign the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act into law, which is a very important thing for our farmers. And I think maybe more important for our people.

Rollins : Yes, sir.

Trump : The people that drink milk. This is the first bill signing of the new year and it will ensure that millions of school-aged children have access to high quality milk as we make America healthy again. I want to thank Secretary of Agriculture, Rollins:, who's behind me; Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Senators Boozman: and Mike Crapo, Roger Marshall, Peter Welch, as well as Representative GT Thompson and Walberg: all great people. Also with us today is USDA National Nutrition Advisor, Dr Carson:, my friend for a long time. We went head to head and it was not easy going head to head with Ben. Where's Ben? He's a great -- he still looks good. That's because he drinks a lot of milk. And some of our nation's wonderful dairy farmers and their children.

They're going to be farmers for a long time, we hope. As it currently stands, schools participating in the National School Lunch Program are only able to offer students low or nonfat milk options. That was changed during the Obama administration and a lot of people disagreed with it at the time. With this legislation, schools will finally be able to expand their offerings to include nutritious whole milk.

It's actually a legal definition, whole milk, and it's whole with a W, for those of you that have a problem. Most of the media will get that. This is the perfect follow up to the new real food pyramid, and Secretary Kennedy and Secretary Rollins announced that last week, you probably heard. This legislation also allows parents to directly request a substitute for milk for children with dairy intolerance.

Previously, parents were required to submit a written statement from a doctor, but we're eliminating that rather ridiculous policy, allowing parents to choose what is best for their child, which is a big move. Hard to believe that that would be a big thing, but it is. And of course, these changes will be major victories for the American dairy farmers who we love and who voted for me in great numbers, I will say.

I think I got every one of them. In December, I also signed the Secure Rural Schools Authorization -- Reauthorization Act. And I'm proud to say that these two pieces of legislation will give school-aged children across the country, the resources and support that they need, not just to succeed, but really to thrive in life and later on in life. tary Rollins to say a few things.

And then I'd like to ask Secretary Kennedy and Dr. Carson. I'd also like to hear from these great political leaders, Senators, Congressmen, if they'd like to say something. I'd be honored. So, Brooke, do you want to start?

Brooke Rollins: Yes, sir, thank you. And what a joy and an honor it is to be here. I feel like I have the best job in the world with representing all of these farmers. And Mr. President, not in our lifetime has a president been a president who loves and supports our farmers more and certainly the dairy farmers. I want to thank all of our farmers here today, sir.

Most of them are fifth and sixth generation. They represent states from all across our country. And bringing the children too and seeing what the next generation of dairy farmers looks like. The amazing thing is some of these farmers, back here from Butler, Pennsylvania, he --

Trump : Where?

Rollins : Butler, Pennsylvania. [Laughter]

Trump : I love Butler, I do.

Rollins : And they love you, they love you. But he milks about 40 to 60 cows. And then we have Jamie from Wisconsin who milks about 5,000 cows. So, they represent all across the spectrum and what this means. And I think it's important to note that in the last year, your support for these American farmers, for rural America, the One Big, Beautiful Bill was the largest investment in rural America in history.

I think that's important to note. The trade, and I see my friend Jamieson Greer over there and Howard Lutnick on this end, we've opened up more than 24 different markets. Milk exports, dairy exports are up 23 percent just in the last year. And when you think about the ag deficit that happened under Joe Biden and the four years, we went from a surplus of agricultural products when we left the first time to a $50 billion deficit when we came back.

So, these are massive, massive wins for America and I think it's important to note that. I also want to note, and you said it as well that over a decade ago, Michelle Obama in this very room made an announcement on a short-sighted campaign to ditch the whole milk in schools and that's what we're working to fix today.

Last week, Bobby Kennedy and Ben Carson and Dr. Oz and the whole crew, sir, announced the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2025 to 2030, which also reintroduced full fat dairy into a healthy diet. And today, by signing this bill, Senator Marshall and Congressman Thompson and all the wonderful men to the right who worked so hard on this, Peter Welch, it is a bipartisan issue and understanding where we are in this country and how important the health of certainly our children are is so important.

USDA is posting today the guidance. So, we're signing the bill and USDA -- we're moving at Trump time -- is posting today the new rulemaking that is necessary to get whole milk back into school lunches. So, that's a really, really big deal.

Trump : So, how long will that take?

Rollins : It should just take a few weeks and then the milk starts moving in. So, it's a big announcement, sir, for our schools and our children. And I know Secretary Kennedy will talk a little bit about the health issue, so I won't do that. I'll skip over that. You mentioned and the last thing I'll say, I know we're here to sign the bill on whole milk, but Senator Crapo's work and our wonderful friend Doug LaMalfa, who we lost way too soon, their work on securing Rural Schools Reauthorization Act, how important that too is for rural America. 700 eligible rural counties across the nation are now guaranteed funds for schools and roads and infrastructure.

So, sir, you say it all the time, those are your people. They voted for you and with us and saw your vision from the beginning. This is who we're here to support today in addition to the whole milk for healthy schools, which will help all children. Just remember, eat real food and drink whole milk. What a joy, again, it is to be here, and I especially want to thank all of our incredible farmers for what you do. So, sir, with that, I'll turn it over to Secretary Kennedy.

Trump : And just before you do that, how are we doing with food prices -- bringing them down?

Rollins : Yes, sir. Well, I'm glad you asked because I brought a chart and -- that just happened to be right behind me. So, speaking of milk, milk is actually way down. And I know we're here to talk about that today, obviously.

Trump : 44 percent.

Rollins : That's right, sir.

Trump : 44 percent down -- milk 44 percent down.

Rollins : Eggs are way down; milk is way down. This is just since we took office, sir. Fresh whole chicken down 2 percent, cheese down, tomatoes down, butter down. Of course, eggs are way down. Potatoes down almost 3 percent, fresh fruits down almost 3 percent. But this is just the beginning. And as we continue to bring the cost of farming down, bring the cost of inputs down, open up the markets, support our farmers, we'll see even more affordability moving forward.

Trump : And eggs are down 31 percent. So, that's really something. Where's Bobby?

Rollins : Bobby's right here.

Kennedy Jr. : Right here, Mr. President.

Trump : Go ahead wherever you are, go ahead. We like Bobby.

Kennedy Jr.: I want to echo what Brooke said about finally having a president that sees the alignment between farm prosperity, good food policy and health of our children. These are common sense associations. Democrats have been talking about them for eons. Republicans have been talking about them. We finally have a president who is implementing these policies and getting real food to our children.

Today, President Trump signs the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act of 2025, a long overdue correction to the school nutrition policy that puts children's health first. For years, Washington treated fat, especially saturated fat, as the enemy. It made a war on saturated fat. This is the peacetime president, made eight-and-a-half deals ending wars and he's also ended the war on saturated fat.

As a result, all the 2 percent milk disappeared from school menus, even though science has never shown that whole milk harms children. Evidence increasingly shows the opposite. The panoply of nutrients in whole milk is critical to brain development and physical development in our children. All in, 2 percent milk provides 13 essential ingredients critical for growth, development, immune system function and overall health, including protein, calcium, vitamin D and healthy fats.

Since these milk options were removed more than a decade ago, school milk consumption and meal participation have declined dramatically. Today between 68 percent and 94 percent of school age boys and girls fail to meet recommended dairy intake according to federal guidelines. And schools limit milk choices.

The kids do not move to healthier substitutes; they move to caffeinated drinks, to sugar drinks and to sweetened beverages with little or no nutritional value. And the potential to wreak havoc on metabolic health, which is driving the chronic disease epidemic in our country. During the same period that whole milk was regulated out of lunchroom, rates of childhood obesity and diabetes rose significantly.

Removing whole milk did not improve health, it damaged it. Thanks to President Trump's leadership this law fixes that mistake. It allows schools in the National School Lunch Program to offer whole reduced fat, low fat or fat free, flavored or unflavored, organic or conventional. It restores choice to schools, parents and students and encourages consumption of nutrient dense foods that kids will actually drink.

The law also removes unnecessary bureaucracy by allowing parents or legal guardians to request milk substitutes without the necessity of involving a doctor. And it corrects a flawed technical rule by excluding fluid milk from saturated fat calculations that distorted school menus. Milk fat is not junk food.

Treating it that way, undermined nutrition and ignored the science. Last week, Secretary Rollins and I unveiled President Trump's new food pyramid and updated our dietary guidelines with a clear message -- eat real food. This law puts that principle into action. As Secretary of Health and Human Services I support this reform because it aligns federal policy with evidence-based nutrition, not ideology or dogma.

Healthy kids need real food, they need real protein, they need healthy fats and they need policies grounded in reality and science. I want to thank President Trump again for his vision, for signing this bill, for continuing to put children's health first. This is exactly the kind of practical change that will make America wealthy again.

Trump : Thank you both. Thank you, Bobby. We have some milk here -- it's been sitting here for five days, so -- [Laughter] It's from the original bottle and I brought it so the press can have some -- you can swig it all out of the same bottle. [Laughter] Remember the old days when we were kids, everybody shared a bottle.

Today, we tend not to do that. But if you'd like to -- if you trust the person that you're drinking after, it's right here, it's yours, OK? It's semi-fresh five, six days old. Thank you. So, Carson:, a special man, knows a lot about health, he looks better than ever. So, Ben, how about it?

Ben Carson: Well, thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for being interested in the health of the people. It's made a big difference; and facilitating an atmosphere where the agency work together, you know, Secretary Rollins, Secretary Kennedy, Marty Makary, Dr. Oz, the whole group, every week at least meeting once to talk about these things and it's made a big difference.

And I want to thank the dairy farmers. I know you guys have been in the doghouse for a little while. You're out of the doghouse as of today.

Unidentified : Yes, sir.

Carson : And, you know, whole milk is a wonderful beverage, good protein. We talk about real food. It is real food, healthy fats, important nutrients. You look at vitamin D, you look at calcium phosphorus, the things that are absolutely essential for bone development and for our teeth. But as a neurosurgeon, the thing I really like is with the brain, what it does for the brain. You know, the -- the brain starts to develop right after conception and adds millions of neurons every single day, continues to do that right up until the mid to late 20s. Now, it's important what that brain is getting during the development. Is it getting soda or is it getting milk?

Trump : So milk would help your cognitive ability?

Carson : Absolutely. You can tell who's been drinking milk.

Trump : Cognitive test. Have taken a lot of them. I've got -- I've aced every one of them because I drink milk.

Carson : It's good for it and it shows.

Trump : You consider there to be a big difference in taste between what you were having and --

Unidentified : Oh, yeah.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Trump : This is just -- it just looks so good sitting there, right?

Unidentified : Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

Trump : It looks better, nice, thick. Go ahead, Ben, sorry to interrupt you.

Carson : You know, when you go up to the school and you give the kids milk, real milk, they love it. When you pour the stuff that looks like, you know, dish pan water, they don't want that. It doesn't taste good either. So this is a great day. It's only a part of what's happening with our emphasis on health. You know, our longevity has been going down and other industrialized nations have been going up, and it's because we haven't been paying attention to this. That has changed and we want to thank you for your leadership.

Trump : Well, thank you very much, Ben. I appreciate it. I appreciate all you've done too for the country. I'd like to ask a few of our Senators to say a couple of words. Maybe we should start with the Democrat in our midst, what do you think, huh?

Unidentified: Peter. Peter Welch. Peter Welch. And thank you very much for being here, Peter.

Welch : No, thank you. You know, our dairy farmers are so vitally important and they have a way of life that transmits from one generation to another and it's tougher than ever for our dairy farmers in Vermont. Our dairy farmers in Pennsylvania and others, South Carolina are here, but they're the lifeblood of the community.

Nobody works harder and nobody does things that are better for our nutrition and also for our kids. I'm in agreement. Kids having access to healthy milk is -- good milk, whole milk, is really good for them. And one of the things that I get very excited about, really, the Vermont farmers talked about is, they have their milk from their farm that then goes directly to many of our schools.

And then kids come out to the farms and start seeing how milk is made, what farming is about. That's good for America. It's not a party deal. This has been a bipartisan effort. I appreciate working with my colleague, Senator Marshall, who did a great job, and GT when I was in the House. And Tim, thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.

Trump : Thank you, Peter. It's got to be like a 90/10 issue. Another one of those things. It's good to have you on our side.

Welch : Yeah.

Trump : But it's a great -- it's a great issue and it's a great thing to do and we're very proud of it. We're very proud of our farmers. Senator, do you want to say a few words?

Mike Crapo : Sure, I'll be very brief; we -- we all want to see you sign this bill. But I really appreciate you and Brooke bringing up the secure rural schools legislation. This is critical legislation to our rural communities across this country, and we have to fight every couple of years to get it extended just a couple of years.

And this extension we got this year, went back to pick up a few years that we missed and is going to expire again at the end of the next year. And Mr. President and Secretary, I'm going to encourage us to get back in here to sign a -- a secure rural schools bill that is permanent. I want to set a goal or hope that you'll set a goal with me to get that done. Thank you.

Trump : Thank you very much. Great. Anybody? Please. Roger?

Roger Marshall : Yeah. Yeah. Mr. President, thank you so much for -- for having us here. On behalf of Kansas dairy farmers, thank you. Milk is the most wholesome, nutritious drink known to humankind. Not only is it full of essential nutrients, it's full of healthy fats as well as protein. As Dr. Carson pointed out, those healthy fats are what helps that brain develop and help you absorb the fat soluble vitamins.

The protein is why you drink milk and you're not hungry again in 30 minutes. And I have to point out that under the previous couple administrations ago, thanks to them, we have a whole generation of young adults who have osteopenia and osteoporosis because they never drank milk for an entire generation. So getting milk back in the schools is going to give us healthy bones and healthy minds. It sticks to your ribs and it tastes great. Thanks for your leadership.

Trump : Thank you very much.

Marshall : Yes, sir, Mr. President. Thank you.

Trump : Anybody? Politically, first, and then we're going to go to the farmers. Yes, please.

John Boozman : Mr. President, thank you so much. I want to ask Dr. Carson if there's an age limit on the cognitive ability [Inaudible] drinking a whole lot more. Thank you so much. We literally have legislatures here -- legislators here that have worked on this for years. This is something that's been very, very difficult. You're able to help us get it.

Trump : You think it would have been very easy, actually.

Boozman : Exactly, but you were able to help us get it over the finish line, you and your great team, Brooke and all of these -- these people have done such a good job, not only with this issue but all that we're doing for the farm community, which is so, so very important. So thank you very, very much and I know that you're going to continue to support farmers like you have --

Trump : We do, right from the beginning.

Boozman : -- since you were elected. Thank you.

Trump : Thank you very much. Go ahead.

Glenn Thompson : Mr. President, GT Thompson --

Trump : Yep.

Thompson : -- chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. I have been working on this bill for 15 years and thank you.

Trump : That's amazing.

Thompson : Because of your support and your leadership, we were able to get this across the line.

Trump : It's such a shame that it would be so hard.

Thompson : Oh, common sense would -- it was lost. And -- and the -- you know, the benefits today go to those precious children that we see over there. It goes to our dairy farm families who work so hard, seven days a week. There's no day off for a dairy farmer. And quite frankly, our rural communities, who when the misguided move to take whole milk and two percent milk and flavor out of schools, we lost a generation, probably two generations of milk drinkers and it devastated those rural communities.

Because you lose the dairy farms, then you lose all the supplies businesses and then you lose grocery stores and you lose community pharmacies. Well, that day ends today with your signature and we reverse that trend and we build a robust rural economy. And I'll just close with what will be the theme of my next bumper sticker, Whole Milk Hills.

Rollins : Amen.

Trump : Yep. That's right. That's what they say. I think it's probably true. Anybody else?

Tim Walberg : Well, Mr. President, chairman of Education Workforce Committee, this fits, you know, with the kids with what they -- they can enjoy in school and grow from. Also to have GT Thompson sponsor the bill on that committee and I think I've worked with you for 15 years now, but we finally got it done in committee. This makes an impact for education, for our workforce, the health that's there and the reality of what this farming industry does. I live in the most diverse farm district in Michigan. Thanks for coming to Michigan yesterday.

Trump : Yeah, it was great.

Walberg : And my kids were raised on -- it's legal now, raw milk taken right out of the bulk tank. And my oldest son became a Pulitzer nominated journalist for the Chicago Tribune and I think the milk did it, right?

Thompson : Over the top.

Walberg : Then I had the benefit of -- of Dr. Carson being a graduate of Andrews University in my district. So all of that goes together. Thank you for signing this. It'll make a difference.

Trump : Great job. So how about a couple of the farmers? Would anybody like to speak? Would you like --

Unidentified : Yeah, do you want --

Trump : Do you want to just say how great milk is?

Unidentified : It's so amazing.

Rollins : So amazing.

Unidentified : Yes, Mr. President, we want to say thank you for doing this. It's been stated several times, how long this took. And so thank you for your support and leadership and finally making this happen. As a mom and a dairy farmer, this isn't just a big win for the dairy farm families across the country, but as it's been said, the millions of school-aged age kids that depend on school lunches for their nutrition and to fuel their bodies. So thank you.

Trump : So they've been fighting this for years now [Inaudible]

Unidentified : 15 years.

Trump : Wow. Have you been fighting --

Unidentified : Before these kids.

Trump : You're too young to be fighting. Have you been fighting it for that long [Inaudible]

Unidentified : For a while, we've been fighting it. I mean, I think I speak for everybody, it's been a long time coming, so your leadership is it.

Trump : Incredible. Well, it's great. I had no idea you were -- just seems to make sense, right? It's hard to believe. When you said 15 years, I said, you have to be kidding. It's -- government is tough. Government can be very tough. How about you? Would you like to say something?

Unidentified : So, we're very grateful and thankful that you pass this bill because it is common sense as to what we should be consuming, whole foods and whole milk. Unfortunately, that has not been the case for a few years, but research shows and our MAHA movements have been taking the right steps to make America healthy.

And our children are growing into active teenagers and athletes, and what do they need? They need strong bones. They need the energy. They need the healthy muscles, and so, we are so grateful that the science is there and we are actually at the right point and the right step, making sure America is healthy. So, we are very thankful.

Rollins : Well said.

Trump : It's so great. I look forward to getting it all the time. [Laughter] I open a refrigerator; I say milk with rice and milk with water and milk with everything. And I say what kind of milk is it? That's what I like right there. That's great. Thank you very much. Beautiful. Please, ma'am.

Patrice Onwuka: Hi, my name is Patrice Onwuka:, and I am the center director at the Independent Women's Forum. I work on economic policies, but I'm also a mom of boys, as you can see. This is Jesse, he's -- Jesse, do you want to say your name and age?

Jesse Onwuka: My name is Jesse. I am six years old -- I am seven years old. I want to be an engineer when I grow up. I am a first grader. I also know where does milk come from.

Unidentified: Good job, good job.

Trump : Where does it come from?

Jesse Onwuka: So, first farmers milk it and then next they put it into a cold tank and then they -- to take the germs out, they put it very hot and then they put it back in the cold tank and then they haul it to somewhere that is cold in a big refrigerator.

Trump : That is unbelievable. I'm going to give him a medal. Yeah. Everybody, these guys want it. Let me tell you, politicians want it, I'm going to give that to you, is that OK?

Onwuka : Thank you, sir.

Trump : Thank you. That's beautiful. Wow.

Onwuka : And this is Daniel, his younger brother. Daniel, how old are you?

Daniel Onwuka: Five.

Onwuka : And what grade are you in?

Daniel Onwuka : Kindergarten.

Onwuka : Kindergarten. And these boys are involved in sports; they go to a public school in the Maryland area. And many of their friends are drinking the kind of options that they don't really like. And so, it's good that as they get to drink a glass of milk every morning, their friends will be able to drink that at school as well. So, thank you very much for what you're doing for public school kids in particular.

Trump : I think it's great. Beautiful boys. Beautiful people. Thank you very much. Doing a great job too.

Onwuka : Thank you.

Trump : Please.

Amber Schwartz: I'm Amber Schwartz, I'm also with Independent Women, but I'm here with my son, Luke, who is 13 years old. We're in Alexandria, Virginia. Luke needs a lot of protein right now to grow. In fact, his doctor just told us between 60 and 70 grams a week. And that's -- I can't feed him a whole chicken every day.

So, supplementing with milk is really helping us. Unfortunately, at school they've offered skim milk and chocolate, and he does not like either. And so, he has been turning to the juice boxes and other drinks that have sugar. And so, thank you for giving him the opportunity, and parents too, to make a choice.

Trump : That's great. That's really great. How about you?

Unidentified : Thank you, Mr. President. I'm the one --

Trump : His beautiful red hair. [Laughter]

Unidentified : Yeah, I tried the match here. But I'm the aforementioned one from Butler, Pennsylvania. So, we -- you know that place very well and we still love you. So, but, Mr. President, I was thinking last night when I was milking what I was going to say. And I thought, well, this is such a monumental day in agriculture, not just dairy farmers, but for all of agriculture because this helps me as a producer, helps the processors, it also helps these kids here. So, it's good all-around and this is perfect legislation, a great day for America is what this is.

Trump : Thank you very much, beautifully said and we appreciate it. And it is a great place that you come from. I love it. Please.

Unidentified : Mr. President. Thank you. It's an honor to be here and, you know, I think this is about choices. This day has been a long time coming. We've been waiting on this for many years and it's great that we're able to provide choices now in schools with whole milk. Well, thank you for that and thank you for everything that you do for the dairy industry -- that us dairy farmers produce valuable nutrients every day for consumers.

Trump : So, you're going to need to produce more milk because you're not mixing it up with all sorts of things, right?

Unidentified : That's right.

Trump : That's great. How much of an increase will that be? Do you have any idea? A lot more, right?

Unidentified : A lot more, absolutely.

Trump : That's great. Boy, that's so good for the industry. Hard to believe you had to wait so long.

Unidentified : Mr. President, I'd like to thank you again for your support behind this and the gentleman standing behind you, like you said, we worked 15 years on it. I advocate for our industry a lot out in the community and I know -- I've been in high schools; I've been in middle schools where the students want milk.

I did a taste test one time at a high school where we gave them whole milk versus the skim milk their school was giving them. The kids loved the whole milk. So, just your support behind us, your support getting it pushed through. I really appreciate what you've done and what the gentlemen behind you were able to do.

Trump : We support the farmer. The farmer knows what's right better than anybody else. Bobby would tell you that. The farmer, they know what's right, especially when it comes to things like this. Sorry it took so long, it was 15 years. I can't believe it. Howard, would you like to say something?

Howard Lutnick: What's amazing is that the president has the leadership and common sense to drive the right outcomes. Why should kids not be given the choice to drink whole milk? How is that even possible? So, it's amazing to work for you because you just own common sense and you're driving it through our economy, you're driving it through the farmers, got great leadership in Secretary Rollins and Secretary Kennedy. And it's great fun to be here because -- I mean think of it today. I mean, how much fun is this? It's just common sense, come on.

Trump : Like the Oval Office.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Trump : Even the media, they come here, and they're here a lot, but it's sort of like you're in the Oval Office, it's the whole ball game. It all begins and ends and then rebegins here. There is no place like it, right? There's no place like it. If you love the country, especially, there's no place like it. So, thank you. Thank you, Howard, very much. So, let's sign it. Should I sign it? Your last chance. [Laughter] It could go another 15 years. Let's do it, do it.

Rollins : You go stand right there by the president.

Trump : Come on, yeah. We have to do a good one here. This is, right? This is an important one for me. OK, not bad, not bad. It's signed by Autopen. So, you can never make a mistake. They made a lot of mistakes. Anyway, here it is. Thank you. Thank you all very much. You have it. Thank you.

Unidentified : Thank you. Thank you.

Trump : I'm going to start drinking a lot of milk. [Laughter]

Unidentified : We appreciate it.

Trump : OK, thank you very much. That's great. Hold that on for a little while. You'll give it to us later, OK? It's a good job you did.

Unidentified : That's great.

Trump : So, any questions on what we just signed?

Question : Mr. President, on Iraq --

Trump : Let's talk about this.

Question : I've got one on milk. Coming from a family -- my dad was a dairy engineer from Texas Tech.

Trump : So, you're a big strong guy.

Question : I drank lots of whole milk in my day. Would you look at this as being a shift from when the industry kind of went woke with the oat milk and the almond milk?

Trump : It's going the exact -- it's amazing.

Question : It's going exactly the opposite direction. Let's talk about the impact of dairy farmers on this whole milk thing.

Trump : There are a lot of changes being made in the last year, as you know. We're still a little bit less than a year. I think there's probably never been a year like this for a president or for a country. We have tremendous success. We've had success with everything we've done, and the economy now is coming back.

And here's an example of farmers are going to be working harder to produce because it's not going to be watered down by something, and it's great to see it. And if you'd like a sip of that, I'd give it to you. It's actually been here -- it's only been here for a few minutes before we started. It's not five days -- five days and open right now, it's not. It's an honor. What we've done in the country in the last year, it's incredible -- all of us together. It's incredible. So, I appreciate the question.

Question : Mr. President, on Iran, you said that the killing has stopped. Who told you that the killings have stopped there? If it's the Irani regime --

Trump: We have been informed by very important sources on the other side and they've said the killing is stopped and the executions won't take place. There were supposed to be a lot of executions today and that the executions won't take place and we're going to find out. I mean, I'll find out after this; you'll find out. But we've been told on good authority, and I hope it's true. Who knows? Who knows? Crazy world.

Question : So, how do you trust them?

Trump : You've seen that over the last few days. And they said people were shooting at them with guns and they were shooting back. And you know, it's one of those things. But they told me that there'll be no executions. And so, I hope that's true.

Question : Does this mean military action is now off the table against Iran?

Trump : We're going to watch and see what the process is, but we were given a very good -- very good statement by people that are aware of what's going on.

Question: Mr. President, are you considering military action, is that still a threat?

Note: [Crosstalk]

Trump : No executions, everybody is talking about a lot of executions were taking place today. We were just told no executions. I hope that's true. That's a big thing. Yes, ma'am.

Question : The foreign minister of Greenland, she said a while ago in a press conference in an embassy of Denmark that she made very clear in the meeting that happened here in the White House, what are their limits? She also said that it was a very respectful meeting. Are those limits going to be respected?

Trump : Well, we're going to see what happens with Greenland. We need Greenland for national security, so we're going to see what happens. They're going to brief me on the meeting right after this conference. In fact, the sooner I get you out, the faster, I'm going to know exactly what happened, but we have a very good relationship with Denmark, as you know.

We'll see. But uh, you know, we're doing the Golden Dome. We're doing a lot of things and we really need it. Uh, if we don't go in, Russia is going to go in and China is going to go in. And there's not a thing that Denmark can do about it, but we can do everything about it.

Question : There's no [Inaudible] what they can do [Inaudible]

Trump : Well, we're going to see. I mean, look, we're going to see what happens, but we need it. You know, I'm not the first one. This was talked about by President Truman and 40 years before President Truman they were talking about it. They've been talking about this for a hundred years. This is not anything so new.

A lot of people don't realize that, but this was a hot subject, probably not as hot as it is now, but it was a hot subject for a long time. We need it for national security and that includes for Europe. And I spoke with, as you know, Mark, the head of NATO, and he really wants to see something happen.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Trump : Very important for national security.

Question : Mr. President, it's been reported that Health and Human Services released frozen funds to Planned Parenthood. I'm wondering why this happened and why Planned Parenthood is receiving any federal funds?

Trump : I don't know anything about that. Bobby, do you know anything about that?

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. : What was the question?

Question : It's being reported that frozen funds were released to Planned Parenthood in December by HHS. I'm wondering why that happened.

Trump : I haven't heard --

Kennedy Jr. : I haven't heard of that.

Trump : I have not heard that.

Question : Mr. President, on NATO -- on NATO. Right now, it sounds like you are saying that you would potentially acquire Greenland by force. That would be a NATO country --

Trump : Well, you're saying that.

Question : Are you saying that would you do that? Would you do that?

Trump : No, you're saying that.

Question : Would you acquire them by force right now?

Trump : You're telling me that that's what I'm going to do. You don't know what I'm going to do.

Question : So what are the options then, because the --

Trump : Your network doesn't know either.

Question : -- the Danish foreign minister said that there's still fundamental differences after the meeting with Rubio and with the vice president. Are you willing to uh leave the NATO alliance in order to get what you want with Greenland? What are the options right now?

Trump : Well, I wouldn't be telling you what I'm willing to do. Certainly, I'm not going to give up options, but it's very important. Greenland is very important for the national security, including of Denmark. And the problem is, there's not a thing that Denmark can do about it if Russia or China wants to occupy Greenland.

But there's everything we can do. You found that out last week with Venezuela. There's everything we can do about things such as that, not going to happen. Uh, we're not -- you know, I can't rely on Denmark being able to fend themselves off. You know, they were talking about they put an extra dog -- and they were serious about this. They put an extra dog sled there last month. They added a second dog sled. That's not going to do the trick.

Question : Denmark fought alongside the United States in both Afghanistan and --

Trump : Thank you for telling me that. I appreciate it very much.

Question : But –

Trump : I have a very good relationship with Denmark and we'll see how it all works out. I think something will work out. Yeah, please.

Question : On Venezuela, Cabello, the -- the de facto number two in Venezuela right now, he seemed pretty reluctant to work with the US. And obviously, he's in --

Trump : With us? They just gave us 50 million barrels of oil.

Question : [Inaudible] the number two, the Venezuela security chief.

Trump : I know the number one. We just had a great conversation today and she's a terrific person. I mean, she's somebody that we've worked with very well. Marco Rubio is dealing with her. I dealt with her this morning. We had a call, a long call. We discussed a lot of things, and I think we're getting along very well with Venezuela.

Question : [Inaudible] the new assistant attorney general position dedicated to rooting out fraud in the United States?

Trump : Yeah, he's fantastic. The person is fantastic.

Question : Who is?

Trump : It's a he. I will tell you maybe within minutes. I mean, I don't know if it's appropriate to say yet because we're going through a process, but we have chosen a person who's very tough, very smart, very fair.

Question : You gave a speech yesterday in Michigan about how you've recalibrated the American economy to work for workers, US auto factories. We've seen core inflations completely [Inaudible] to lower the trade deficits, the lowest amount since 2009. American exports are growing, but we're also waiting on the Supreme Court case for the tariffs. Given the success that you've had in the first 12 months, what is at stake in this case?

Trump : A little bit like whole milk, I can't believe we even have a case. This was a case started by a very China-centric people and also anti-American people, frankly, people that don't want us to do well. Tariffs have helped us stop eight wars. They've helped us get the best trade numbers we've ever had. They've helped us get $18 trillion brought into the country.

And maybe above all else, they've given us tremendous national security, just the threat of tariffs. You saw that just yesterday when I put tariffs on a certain country. We won't talk about that country, but you know who it is based on the fact that if you do business with that country, you know, it's going to make them -- It's going to bring them to the table a lot faster.

So we have made hundreds of billions of dollars with tariffs. We have very little inflation. Think of it, inflation has gone down and productivity, everything has gone up. We've never taken in money like we have. We've never had anywhere near $18 trillion invested in our country, neither has any other country.

It's the biggest number by maybe five times, five times, not five percent, five times. Nobody's ever seen numbers like this. We have plants going up -- you know, you mentioned, I was in Michigan yesterday. I was at the Ford plant where they make the Ford F-150. It's one of the original plants. It was from before World War I. It's a giant plant.

That plant was probably going to be closed and two years ago, they were doing very poorly. And now they just announced yesterday that they're going to go 24 hours around the clock, three shifts, which they rarely do. That's Ford and Ford's having the best numbers they've ever had. General Motors having the best numbers they've ever had.

Stellantis, which hasn't been here, is now investing billions, tens of billions of dollars on building in the country. We're building auto plants all over the country. We're building AI all over the country. We're leading China by a lot and a lot of it has to do with tariffs. That would be a very disappointing decision and especially since the people that are fighting me are people that want China to do well.

And we're doing great against China. We're doing great against everybody. We -- we're the hottest country anywhere in the world. As I say often, we're right now the hottest country anywhere in the world and a year and a half ago, we were a dead country. Thank you very much, everybody. List of Speakers
