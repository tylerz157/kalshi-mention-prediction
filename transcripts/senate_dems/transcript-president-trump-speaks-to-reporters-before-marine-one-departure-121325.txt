Question: Mr. President, do you have a response to the attack in Syria?

President Trump: So we mourn the loss of three great patriots in Syria. You know how it happened. It was an ambush. It's terrible. We also have three wounded. They seem to be doing pretty well. But we mourn the loss. These are great -- three great people. And it's just a terrible thing. Syria, by the way, was fighting along with us. The President -- the new President of Syria is, as they told me, and I'm not surprised, he's devastated by what happened. This was an ISIS attack on us and Syria. And again, we mourn the loss, and we pray for them and their parents and their loved ones. Very, very sad.

Trump: Yeah, we will.

Question: And will U.S. force there attack again?

Trump: We're going to be seen.

Question: Will the U.S. still be --

Trump: We will retaliate. Thank you very much.
