President Donald Trump: I wanted to thank the countries that helped me put this together: Qatar, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, and so many others. So many people fought so hard. This is a big day. We'll see how it all turns out. We have to get the final word down in concrete. Very importantly, I look forward to having the hostages come home to their parents, and having some of the hostages, unfortunately, you know, the condition they're in, come home likewise to their parents, because their parents wanted them just as much as though that young man or young woman were alive. So, I just want to let you know that this is a very special day, maybe unprecedented in many ways, it is unprecedented. But thank you all, and thank you all to those great countries that helped. We were given a tremendous amount of help. Everybody was unified in wanting this war to end, and seeing peace in the Middle East, and we're very close to achieving that. Thank you all, and everybody will be treated fairly.
