President Trump: Well, this is very exciting. This was one of the greatest moments in the history of US sports, I wouldn't say maybe for other countries who weren't so thrilled. But for US sports and we have a very exciting team of champions standing behind me, Mr. Attorney, could you read what we're doing right now and get it done?

Will Scharf: Yes, sir. This is HR 452, the Miracle on Ice bill, the United States Congress has authorized three medals to be struck commemorating the historic victory of the United States' men's hockey team in 1980 at the Lake Placid Olympics where they obviously defeated the Russians in the -- the Soviet Union, excuse me, in the famous Miracle on Ice hockey game.

Scharf: This will serve as a fitting commemoration of that incredible achievement and will hopefully be a lasting memorial of that achievement going forward, sir.

Trump: This was an amazing event, pretty big. I mean, I don't know -- there were some other upsets in the world. I haven't noticed them getting any of these, right? [Laughter] That's great. I mean, we don't use auto pens here. [Laughter] It's a great achievement. OK, wait a minute there. There you go, Mike.

Scharf: Thank you, sir.

Trump: So great, right? Most of these people are too young to remember, but sports fans know it. Thank you very much. It's a great honor to have the media too. We're delighted to be joined today by two legends of American sports history and heroes for the entire nation, the 1980 US Olympic ice hockey team. This was one of the biggest moments that I've ever seen in sports and I like sports. These are the men who gave us one of the most storied athletic wins of all time. It's called the Miracle on Ice, and I guess that's what it was. Where -- with us today by players like Jim Craig, Steve Janaszak, Bill Baker, Dave Christian, Ken Morrow, Jack O'Callahan, Mike Ramsey, Neil Bratten, Mike Eruzione, Rob McClanahan, Buzz Schneider, Dave Silk, Phil Verchota and numerous others. And what I'd love for you to do, you know, when you have all of these media people, it's a nice slow afternoon. Nothing's too slow around here. I think we just did a very good job with Thailand and Cambodia. We had them stop. I've been saying I stopped eight wars, but they started shooting at each other two days ago. Wasn't good and we got it I think straightened out today. So Thailand and Cambodia is in good shape. So we get a lot done. Eight wars, nobody's ever stopped, eight wars, we have one more to go. The easiest one I thought would be a country that you're somewhat familiar with, Russia and Ukraine. But we're -- a lot of progress is being made even there. Could I ask you to just say your name and if you have anything to say, you could say that also? And then we'll get on with reading some of the stats.

Ryan Suter: Yeah, my name is Ryan Suter. I'm here representing my dad, Bob, who passed away. Um, it's a true honor for me to be a part of this and thank these guys for allowing me to be a part of their team and thank you for having this and hosting us.

Trump: Your father was some player incredible player. Do you, uh, did you ever play ice hockey?

Suter: I did, yeah. [Laughter]

Trump: So let me ask you how good was he compared to his father?

Suter: Don't answer. [Laughter]

Unidentified: Mr. President, Ryan just played 21 years in the NHL. He played 1,500 games in the NHL.

Trump: Pretty comparable, though, right? Better, you think Better?

Unidentified: Yes. Yes. [Laughter] His dad was tough. [Laughter]

Trump: Heard he might be. Suter: My dad was tougher but you're right. [Laughter]

Trump: Dad was tougher, but you got good genetics. You had a great career. How long did you play?

Suter: I played 21 years.

Trump: Wow, yeah. Well, you look pretty good for a guy who played 21 years. Congratulations and great father.

Suter: Thank you.

Trump: Great father. Please.

Tarja Lewis: Um, I'm Tarja Lewis and I'm here representing my dad, Mark Pavelich. Um, he, I'm so honored to be here. Um, I just -- I -- I'm at a loss for words to be honest, like I can't believe this is real and I want to say to you, President Trump.
