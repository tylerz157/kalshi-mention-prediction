Question: Mr. President, on California. Are you prepared to invoke the Insurrection Act?

President Trump: Uh, depends on whether or not there's an insurrection.

Question: [Inaudible] Camp David, sir, what is the purpose of your meetings at Camp David over the next 24 hours?

President Trump: We're going up to Camp David. We have meetings with various people about very major subjects. Now we thought we'd do it at Camp David. There's probably better security there than anyplace. We'll be meeting with a lot of people, including generals, as you know, and admirals.

Question: What's the bar for sending Marines, the --

President Trump: The bar is what I think it is. I mean, if we see danger to our country and to our citizens, uh, we'll be very, very strong in terms of law and order. It's about law and order.

President Trump: We're gonna see what we need. We'll send whatever we need to make sure there's law and order.

President Trump: Yes, we're gonna be watching it very closely. And uh, where they spit at people, you know, they spit. That's their new thing. They spit and worse. You know what they throw at them, right? And when that happens, I have a little statement. They, they, they spit, we hit. And I told them, "Nobody's gonna spit on our police officers." Nobody's gonna spit on our military. Which they do as a common thing. They get up to them this far away and then they start spitting in their face. That happens, they get hit very hard.

Question: What are the rules, what are the rules to be engagement for federal troops?

Question: How would you define, how would you define an insurrection?

President Trump: You have to really just have to look at the site. You have to see what's happening. Uh, last night in uh, Los Angeles, we watched it very closely. There was a lot of violence there. There was a lot of violence that it could have gotten much worse. And you have an incompetent governor. Just take a look at the, at the train stations that he's building, like 20 times over budget. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. So, uh, I did call him the other night. I said, "look, you gotta take care of this, otherwise I'm sending in the troops." That's what we did. Thank you very much. Do you have a question for Marco? Question for Marco?

Question: Could California officials face federal charges if they stand in the way of the deportations? Something Homan may have just [Inaudible]
