Question : Are you expecting to get the FIFA Peace Prize, Mr. President? What would you say to people who say that prize might conflict with your pledge to strike Venezuela?

Trump : Well, I think the, uh, peace prize, I mean, I settled eight wars. I don't know that I'm getting it. I haven't been officially noticed. I've been hearing about a peace prize, and I'm here to represent our country in a different sense. But, uh, I can tell you, I did settle eight wars and we have a ninth coming, but, and which nobody's ever done before.

But I wanna really save lives. I don't need prizes. I need to save lives, and we're saving a lot of lives. I've saved millions and millions of lives, and that's really what I wanna do. And I also wanna run a great country, and the United States right now is the hottest country anywhere in the world. And one year ago, it was dead.
