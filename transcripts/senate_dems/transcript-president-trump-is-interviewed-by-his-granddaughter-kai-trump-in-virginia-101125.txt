================================================================================

Kai Trump: This is my grandpa. Most people know him as Trump, the 45th and 47th president of the United States. Others know him as a businessman or a politician. But to me, he's just my grandpa. We've been playing golf together for years. It's something he's always loved, and it's become a way for us to spend time together. Over the years, I've learned a lot from being on the course with him, not just about golf but about life. Today, I wanted to bring you along for a round just us playing the game we both love. Join us on the course for this one on one with Kai. This is a really special video, and I hope you guys enjoy.

President Trump: Hello, everybody. We're going to have a little fun today. We have Kai who's done terrifically at golf. She's a really good player. And we're going to play a little bit of the course in Virginia that I think is rated the number one -- I think it's one of the best courses anywhere in the world. It's on the Potomac River.

Trump 00:00:50-00:01:06 (16 sec)

It's Trump National, and it's been really great. Washington, DC -- we call it Trump National Washington, DC. It has the Washington area, and it's been just a great place to play. It's a phenomenal course, and we're going to have a little fun. We'll play best ball.

Kai Trump: Yeah.

Trump” And we'll see how we do, and I think we'll do OK.

Kai Trump: I think we'll do pretty good.

Trump: You're swinging so good so.

Kai Trump: So -- so are you. You're swinging better than me. Always.

Trump: Yeah, well, I don't think so. I don't know. We're going to find out. Have a good time, everybody. I hope you enjoy it.

Kai Trump: Hey, guys. Welcome back to the channel. I'm playing golf today with my grandpa. We're going to do a best ball from the white tees, and I'm feeling pretty good. Feeling a little tired but feeling good. I think we're probably going to -- we're probably going to end up playing really well. So, looking forward to it. My WHOOP has been telling me that like -- actually I was supposed to sleep 11 hours last night. You know how it tells you like that's one plus one that -- tells you like how long you're supposed to sleep? I was supposed to sleep 11 hours. I got like seven hours, but that's all right. I got my accelerator.

Trump: Winning. All right. Got to win. Got to win.

Kai Trump: I'm feeling good. I feel like -- honestly, I feel like a little rusty, you know, at the ripe age of 18 age.

Unidentified: Ripe age, huh?

Kai Trump: You feel old sometimes. That was a good shot. I'll end on that one. My tripod. Can't go anywhere without this. I only use this strictly for golf videos. It literally lives in my golf bag, and it's golf videos I don't even post. It's just swing videos. Just swing -- strictly swing videos. Are you ready?

Trump: You -- like an introduction like that's good I think.

Kai Trump: That's good. You did a great job. You're natural.

Trump: I am.

Kai Trump: You're natural.

Trump: Look at these guys. Thank you. Thank you. Let's go. Come on. Let's go have a good time.

Kai Trump: Is he allowed to respond?

Trump: They don't respond. Yeah.

Kai Trump: I mean, with all that gear on too? Imagine that in Florida right now in 90 degree weather.

Trump: Yeah, they sort of supposed to focus on what they're doing, which is keeping us safe, right?

Kai Trump: Oh, of course.

Trump: Thank you, fellas. Beautiful, huh?

Kai Trump: Look at that. Let me take a photo of it.

Trump: They have a wedding tonight up there. That's the number one wedding site anywhere in the area, honey.

Kai Trump: It's beautiful.

Trump: It's where -- everybody gets married right at the top of the fountain. So, you've used this camera -- this before?

Kai Trump: So, yeah. So --

Trump: Does it go into your major cameras or does it -- is it in here?

Kai Trump: So, this camera -- um, when you edit it, it goes into the video, but the cameras that the guys are holding, the big cameras, this is for if I ask you questions about like what's your -- what's your favorite golf course --

Trump: Are the big cameras -- are the big cameras, uh, better in terms of vision?

Kai Trump: Yes.

Trump: They are.

Kai Trump: Should we turn around?

Trump: No. We'll go right up here. Oh, I see. We're going to play down here, right?

Kai Trump: Do you want to play yellow or --

Trump: What's yellow? A little further back? Doesn't matter -- let's play -- let's play here for the -- for the purposes of --

Kai Trump: First hole. Yeah. All right, guys. So, we're going to do best ball from these tees, um, nine holes and see what happens.

Trump: That's good.

Kai Trump: Yeah. Good shot. There you go.

Trump: Wow. I'd say that's very good, honey. That's pretty good. We're off to a good start.

Kai Trump: Off to a great start.

Trump: Good swing.

Kai Trump: Thank you.

Trump: Always nice to hit that first one good, right?

Kai Trump: Well, it's like the -- it's the most nervous -- nerve wracking shots, the first tee shot. I mean, you don't get nervous but.

Trump: You got a lot of people watching. A lot of people -- clubhouse members up there.

Kai Trump: That's true.

Trump: How nice is this place, though, honey?

Kai Trump: Beautiful with the river. What's your favorite course ever?

Trump: Well, it's very tough to compete with what we have in Scotland, you know?

Kai Trump: Especially the new course, right?

Trump: Especially.

Unidentified: Really good, sir.

Kai Trump: Good shot.

Unidentified: Beautiful.

Kai Trump: All right. I got 100 into the wind. No. Oh, that rough does not seem fun.

Trump: Where is it?

Kai Trump: On the rough. On the right side.

Trump: All right. We're OK.

Kai Trump: At least one of us is on the green.

Trump: It s OK. We're OK swing. Your swing looked great.

Kai Trump: Yeah, it was alright. A little fast with the hands.

Trump: That's all right. Yeah. Yeah, you want to always hit greens from that distance, right?

Kai Trump: Always. I don't -- actually, this is my first time missing a green like from this distance in probably like two months.

Trump: Which -- were you left or right?

Kai Trump: Um, left. I faded it a little too much. I tried hitting incline. Just didn't catch it right.

Trump: I'm in good shape, so we'll be OK.

Kai Trump: You're in perfect shape. Oh. Sit. All right, Grandpa, just go and two putt. I'm picking that up. All right, that's a par.

Trump: You have good distance, don t you? I hit that ball pretty good. I hate to say it. Distance looks good.

Kai Trump: Uh, I've been -- I've been hitting it a lot farther. I've gotten a lot stronger too, so I think that's helped a lot.

Trump: See, this is the back tee right here.

Kai Trump: Yeah.

Trump: It's -- from the back, it's 660.

Kai Trump: Oh, wow.

Trump: And the -- the river is right there.

Kai Trump: Oh, it's awesome. Hole two, par five, 419. I think it's still into the wind, so it's not that bad. It's probably playing like on maybe 440. There you go.

Unidentified: Good.

Trump: Right there.

Kai Trump: Just like that.

Trump: That's a long hit.

Kai Trump: That ball went dead straight. Never -- never moved.

Trump: You do that little cut?

Kai Trump: Um, very little, yeah. Little cut -- little -- little cut, little draw.

Trump: OK.

Kai Trump: In between -- I never do it --

Trump: That's where you want to be. That's what you want -- that's what you want to play, honey.

Kai Trump: No. Exactly. How has it been in the White House so far?

Trump: It's been great. I m having a good time. We have -- doing a great job. I stopped seven wars.

Kai Trump: Yeah.

Trump: Seven. And hopefully we get Putin and Zelenskyy to stop killing everybody.

Kai Trump: Yeah.

Trump: But it's been very good. Economy's been great. Well, it's going to be OK.

Kai Trump: All right. Got a five wood.

Trump: Yeah. You can hit it. You're right into the wind, honey. It s good swing. Beautiful. A little bit right. It's pretty good.

Kai Trump: We'll chip that.

Trump: It s pretty good.

Kai Trump: [Inaudible]

Trump: It's a good idea playing just best ball. Nice, right?

Kai Trump: Doesn't matter, yeah.

Trump: Nice and easy. Maybe I'll do this. You like that?

Unidentified: Yeah.

Trump: Into the wind. It's right into the wind, right? Well, I wouldn't say it was -- I wouldn't say it was Tiger, but it was pretty good.

Kai Trump: It's pretty good. What's your favorite sport to watch besides golf?

Trump: I love watching all sports. I love football when it's good. When it's -- any sport that's meaningful, like if they're playing for something.

Kai Trump: Yeah.

Trump: So, the big tennis tournaments, the big golf tournaments.

Kai Trump: Are you watching the US Open right now?

Trump: Uh, I'm watching the US Open tennis. I'm also -- you look at what's happening with golf. It's the Ryder Cup is coming up.

Kai Trump: Yeah, I know.

Trump: Which maybe is my favorite of all, right?

Kai Trump: Yeah, it's --

Trump: Put it up. Put it up, honey. Oh, that's good. Pretty good.

Kai Trump: Not the best. But from there. All right. First time putting on these greens. See how fast they are, and they look pretty fast. But doesn't really them.

Trump: Right up here, it's pretty fast. Right here, honey.

Kai Trump: Yeah.

Trump: It's pretty fast. Pretty good. Pretty good. Oh, very good. That's a beauty, honey.

Kai Trump: All right. Par, par.

Trump: Par, par.

Unidentified: How are you guys feeling after those two holes?

Kai Trump: Feeling good.

Trump: Good.

Kai Trump: I feel like the first hole I got the jitters out, and I feel good now.

Trump: She -- she -- she was a little jittery on the first hole, but fortunately her grandfather wasn't. Well, we got a par. Could have made a birdie on that hole, right?

Kai Trump: Yeah, I agree right. The way it happens. Do people ever go, um, like on boats like --

Trump: Yeah. Oh, boats are there all the time. Less so when I'm here. You know, so.

Kai Trump: Yeah.

Trump: They cleared it. Hi, kids. There s a great par three coming up. It's a long haul, 250.

Kai Trump: OK. Oh, wow!

Trump: From the back. 257. But we're playing a little bit slightly up from that.

Kai Trump: We're making it a little easier today.

Trump: Nice members we have here.

Kai Trump: Yeah.

Trump: It's been a great success, this course. The river helps it, too. The river helps it. OK. Let's see how we do here. Oh, stop. Oh, I thought it was fine. Put it up. Man, that was the right club, too. Good shot. Get up. That's a beauty, honey.

Kai Trump: [Inaudible]

Trump: That s a beauty.

Unidentified: [Inaudible]

Kai Trump: What would you say?

Unidentified: It's going to be pretty straight.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Trump: OK. Good putt.

Kai Trump: Par, par, par. I got to start hitting it closer so we can make more birdies.

Trump: Yeah. We'll be OK, honey.

Kai Trump: These greens are very, very fast.

Trump: Very fast.

Kai Trump: But this would be a great US Open course. It's built like a US Open course.

Trump: Would be no better course, honey.

Kai Trump: I agree. What's your favorite color?

Trump: Color?

Kai Trump: Yeah.

Trump: Maybe red.

Kai Trump: I feel like now it's like a staple. Like it has to be red.

Trump: Like MAGA?

Kai Trump: MAGA red. One thing about us is that we're very good at tee shots. We don't miss the fairway.

Trump: Good hit. Really good, sweetheart.

Kai Trump: Just like that.

Trump: Really good and really long. You know, she's got a big extension.

Kai Trump: I'm long. I'm very, very long.

Trump: You are, honey. You have that extension. Yeah. All long hitters have the big extension.

Kai Trump: Yeah. Besides Rory. Rory s --

Trump: No, Rory -- Rory's got a great swing.

Kai Trump: Great swing. He uses the ground very well.

Trump: Tiger told me that Rory is the best driver that he'd seen.

Kai Trump: I would agree with that. 1,000 percent.

Trump: And for Tiger to say that, that's amazing, right?

Kai Trump: That s pretty cool.

Trump: Because Tiger is great at everything.

Kai Trump: I agree.

Trump: But he said Rory's a great -- the greatest driver he's seen. OK, which is which?

Kai Trump: That's yours -- oh, you got me. Next time I'm hanging a draw.

Trump: OK. Put it up, honey.

Unidentified: Off bounds.

Kai Trump: The wind s going that way.

Unidentified: Right left [Inaudible]

Trump: Wow. That could be good.

Kai Trump: Sit. Sit.

Unidentified: Good shot.

Trump: Good shot. Into the wind. 190.

Kai Trump: Into the wind, yeah.

Trump: That's a good shot, honey. Cut, cut, cut. Oh, almost. Almost.

Kai Trump: Mine's definitely over. I hit that way too good.

Trump: Oh, did you go over?

Kai Trump: I hit that too good.

Trump: Well, let's get it up.

Kai Trump: We've got to get on it up, no doubt.

Trump: OK, honey. Good putt. Good putt.

Kai Trump: I'm telling you. I got the jitters out of the way on the first hole. Now I'm feeling good. Feeling myself. Especially after that shot 190. I hit a five hybrid. I went over the green, so I probably hit like 200 yards. Now the juices are flowing.

Unidentified: Flowing. Yeah.

Kai Trump: Because I know you like chipping with those -- with the lower loft clubs. For me, I like chipping with 60 degrees and 54s because I like using that extra loft sometimes and to get more spin.

Trump: Keep that one -- it was better if I played it that way.

Kai Trump: Yeah. I would have used it --

Trump: You know why you have to swing too hard with it.

Kai Trump: Yeah. And you have to save it with your hands too, which is not --

Trump: Yeah.

Kai Trump: Like, if I was down here, maybe I'd use a like a 48, like a pitching wedge from down there. But mostly I use my 60 degree a lot. It's my favorite club in my bag.

Trump: How much do you like golf?

Kai Trump: I love golf, you know. I mean, I've been playing golf since I was two years old pretty much or started when I was two years old, and now it's become a huge part of my life.

Trump: We used to have contests to the pin, right?

Kai Trump: Yes. Always. And -- and you just -- you and you beat me.

Trump: We always had good contests, right? Even as a young girl, I knew you were going to be a great golfer.

Kai Trump: Thank you. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to also play at these amazing courses because without, you know, having access to all these great courses, I wouldn't be the golfer I am today. Good shot.

Trump: Thank you.

Kai Trump: Where do you think I should go?

Trump: Right there where I am.

Kai Trump: Play a cut?

Trump: Right down the middle, right?

Kai Trump: I don't know. Cut or draw? Or just hit it dead straight? Probably going to hit it dead straight. Just like that. All right. We play draw.

Trump: See how long the swing is?

Kai Trump: Well, I got -- I got these long arms that create a lot of speed.

Trump: If you don't have the length, you forget. She's got --

Kai Trump: Long arms.

Trump: She's got --

Kai Trump: Long legs. The only issue is -- the only issue is I m 125 pounds, which doesn't really help.

Trump: You've got the length to be really good. You know, if you -- if you don't have the length, it's a problem.

Kai Trump: I agree.

Trump: But you have length, honey. You have a lot of strength.

Kai Trump: But the thing about all of us in our family is we're all athletic. Like, we're all very athletic.

Trump: Good athletes. Yep. Always.

Kai Trump: So, I think without me having that -- without being athletic, I wouldn't be able to hit as hard as I do, but also because I grew up playing other sports and I am athletic, I hit a lot farther, which is a good combination. Right here?

Trump: You see it, honey? It's going to fly a little bit.

Kai Trump: Yeah. No, I agree. Sit.

Trump: It's OK. Not bad.

Kai Trump: All right. We re good. On the green.

Trump: Not bad. How far is it?

Unidentified: 32. I like the --

Trump: [Inaudible]

Kai Trump: Got to work to get my clubs in the golf cart. Should be good.

Trump: I didn't like the way I hit either, but they're OK. You're in good shape on the green.

Kai Trump: Yeah. So, who's your favorite golfer of all time?

Trump: Tiger. Jack.

Kai Trump: I agree.

Trump: I love Jack. I love Gary Player.

Kai Trump: Yeah.

Trump: They're such great athletes. They're great.

Kai Trump: They all are. Gary -- I mean --

Trump: I love -- I love them all.

Kai Trump: Yeah.

Trump: But I think Tiger, Jack, Gary?

Kai Trump: Are the best ones.

Trump: I love Bryson. Bryson. Uh, I think that, uh, Scotty's going to be great too. He already is. Scotty's great.

Unidentified : Closer.

Trump: It s good.

Kai Trump: Look at that.

Trump: That's pretty good.

Kai Trump: He can chip.

Trump: That's a good chip. Not bad. We got our par anyway, so not bad. Not bad. Good looks -- good looking putting stroke I think, right? Long. Do you want a putting guy? This guy's the best putter. You don't get a better putter outside of the top hundred, right? They're good putters. But no, you just don't get a better putter. Your putting is fantastic.

Kai Trump: How's Barron doing at NYU?

Trump: He's doing good. He's a good boy. He loves you. He said --

Kai Trump: He is.

Trump: Say hello to Kai, dad. I said, Barron, why didn't you come out and watch?

Kai Trump: Yeah.

Trump: He said -- you know, he's so cute.

Kai Trump: Did they start school again?

Trump: Yeah, he starts on Tuesday.

Kai Trump: Very nice.

Trump: He's a good boy.

Kai Trump: He is. It's cool how they -- they -- they make sure --

Trump: Thank you very much.

Kai Trump: They're all -- the security is all down the line. It's smart.

Trump: A lot of -- a lot of security.

Kai Trump: You had too many close calls.

Trump: Let's go over here. I had some close calls. That's true, honey.

Kai Trump: Are they this one?

Trump: Yep.

Kai Trump: All right.

Trump: OK.

Kai Trump: I wish I hit my driver like you.

Trump: Down the middle. That's -- that's big length. You know?

Unidentified: It's really good.

Trump: It's big length, honey.

Kai Trump: It's good. I've been doing like a lot of jumping and like explosive stuff to hit it farther.

Trump: You have members [Inaudible] all your members, honey.

Kai Trump: They support you.

Trump: Yep. They've always been good.

Kai Trump: It's good.

Trump: They're great members, great clubs.

Kai Trump: What's like the best advice you can give to someone?

Trump: To love what you do. You got to love what you do, otherwise you're not going to do it well.

Kai Trump: I agree with that.

Trump: You got to love it. See? You have a shot to the pit -- this is a par five?

Kai Trump: Yes.

Trump: Reachable from where you are and where I am.

Unidentified: Perfect.

Trump: Perfect.

Kai Trump: Right at the tree. Just like that.

Trump: Yeah. See, now you have a wedge to the green. That could be on the green.

Kai Trump: Oh, wait. The holes over there?

Trump: Yeah.

Kai Trump: Oh, OK.

Trump: That's close.

Kai Trump: I thought the hole s over there.

Trump: Isn't that close?

Unidentified: It's got to be.

Trump: That could be on the green. Yeah. Partner -- that could be on the green, my little partner.

Kai Trump: See, that's why I have you. You're going to carry me today. It's not like I'm committed to play golf or anything like that. You're going to carry me.

Trump: Yeah. Well. That was a good hit. That's as good as I can hit it.

Kai Trump: There's one thing you always say that, um, that I think is important is that the fairway does not know how old you are.

Trump: That's right.

Kai Trump: The trees and the grass do, though.

Trump: I won a club championship where I was 50 years older than the young guy I played who was a good player. Recently. Can you believe it?

Kai Trump: No.

Trump: And -- and I don't think about golf. I'm not thinking about golf. I'm thinking about other things like Russia and China, right?

Kai Trump: Hey, but honestly, I play better when I don't -- when I'm playing in tournament, when I don't think about golf, I think about other things, I do better.

Trump: OK, honey. Put it up. Perfect. See, you're in perfect shape. Good shot.

Kai Trump: Sit. Oh, it's rolling down.

Trump: Oh. You have a lot of bite on the ball, huh?

Kai Trump: I hit that good, though. Nice and flighted. Compressed.

Trump: You may think about going to a ball that doesn't pull back. Yeah, I noticed you have a lot of bite on the ball, so you could go to -- you could go to a less spin ball.

Kai Trump: Yeah. It's good in Florida, though. But I've been spinning it more -- the more I got stronger, the more I started spinning it, and now I have issues like that because that would have been right by the pin.

Trump: Came all the way back.

Kai Trump: It did.

Trump: [Inaudible]

Kai Trump: I'm just too strong guys. Just too strong.

Unidentified: You want your 60?

Kai Trump: Look at that. Great shot.

Trump: Good shot. Solid.

Kai Trump: As I said, I was just too strong. My ball spun back.

Trump: That had nice action, right?

Unidentified: Great.

Kai Trump: So, one of my teammates on my Benjamin golf team, she gave me a U Miami ball marker. So, I've been using the U Miami ball marker. Hopefully it's good luck. Make some putts today. Let's see. Hit it. Oh. Uh oh. Par par. Just like that. I thought -- I thought mine was going to hit the pin and go in. The uphill putts, you always want to hit farther past the hole. You don't want to end up short.

Trump: Well, except you don't like to leave yourself a downhiller either. See, there's the Potomac, honey.

Kai Trump: I want to take a video of this.

Trump: This can t -- doesn't get prettier. And this is a real river course, not one where they use the word river and there is no river. That's the Potomac River, honey. See the -- there -- that's an Olympic team right there.

Kai Trump: Oh, nice. Oh, yeah. Rowing, right?

Trump: It's a rowing team.

Kai Trump: Do you know if Georgetown grows in the river?

Trump: I think so. They all do.

Kai Trump: This course -- this course is actually sick. This is -- honestly, I think out of all --

Trump: Do you use the black ball?

Kai Trump: Um, yeah. I have a customized with a KT.

Trump: If you go to red, you'll get less spin.

Kai Trump: Yeah, that's true. But I do in Florida, though. I like sticking it close and having it spin.

Unidentified: Pro tip.

Kai Trump: That's my ball. U in Miami on the side.

Trump: How's that, pro? Good? It's funny. I just don't miss fairways, right? Pretty unusual, isn't it? Right.

Kai Trump: Just like that. That's how you guys do it. I want to come out here and play more when I can because this is beautiful. This course --

Trump: It's -- it's Bedminster with the river. That's the quality of it, you know?

Kai Trump: No, it's amazing.

Trump: Think of that, right?

Kai Trump: I -- I --I honestly think -- it actually looks very much like Bedminster just different.

Trump: It's, uh -- because look at the river. Take a picture of that, honey. Show this --

Kai Trump: Yeah.

Trump: You can't show it too much because we're on the river. We're not -- we're not looking at a river. We're on the river. There's no property like this.

Kai Trump: No. That's beautiful. Yeah, it's amazing.

Trump: If I wasn't Trump, this would be a top ten in the nation. Do you understand that?

Kai Trump: I understand.

Trump: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut. That could be good.

Unidentified: Really good, sir. [Inaudible]

Trump: Did that follow the green up there?

Kai Trump: Yeah. It s a good shot.

Unidentified: Good.

Trump: That's pretty good. If it follows the green, we're in good shape.

Kai Trump: What's your favorite White House event that's hosted every year?

Trump: Anything in the White House is my favorite.

Kai Trump: Do you like Christmas in the White House/

Trump: I love the White House, honey.

Kai Trump: I know you do.

Trump: I'm fixing it, you know. I'm making it incredible. Better than it ever was. We're putting marble floors in places that should have it.

Kai Trump: It's going to look amazing. I'm looking forward to seeing the finished product.

Trump: Now put it up. Focus on this. Don't think about it -- don't worry about the White House, honey. I'm taking care of the White House.

Kai Trump: Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Oh, that's like right by the hole.

Unidentified: [Inaudible] Nice hit.

Trump: Good shot, honey. That's a good shot. That's a good shot.

Kai Trump: My legs -- I had to like make sure my legs were nice and, uh, strong over there. What's your favorite snack? Like favorite like -- let's say, if you're on -- like a hot dog?

Trump: Yeah. Well, I love it -- on a golf course?

Kai Trump: Yeah.

Trump: Hot dog is good. Good shot you hit.

Kai Trump: Thank you. Let's make a birdie now. Birdie time.

Trump: I thought I had a better shot. I thought I hit a better shot than that.

Unidentified: That was a really great shot, Kai.

Kai Trump: Appreciate it. You know, I was like almost falling over the ball because the way it was. I was like -- I had to make sure my legs were like nice and stable, so I don't fall over and eat crap.

Trump: All right, honey. Put it up.

Kai Trump: All right. This is going in.

Trump: Get up.

Unidentified: No.

Kai Trump: Oh, it didn't turn at all. All right. We got to make a birdie somewhere. These holes are just going par, par, par.

Trump: Next hole is going to be a birdie.

Kai Trump: All right.

Trump: We're getting good, solid, easy pars. There's nothing wrong with that.

Kai Trump: Nothing at all. Are you looking forward to the White House UFC event?

Trump: Yeah, it's going to be great.

Kai Trump: Am I -- am I invited to that?

Trump: Yeah. You're invited to all events, honey.

Kai Trump: Well, that's going to be awesome. Dana s a great guy. He's awesome. Right there.

Trump: Dana is --

Kai Trump: This is -- this is a beautiful hole.

Trump: The UFC.

Kai Trump: Yeah.

Trump: Dana's a fantastic person.

Kai Trump: I agree.

Trump: Thank you.

Unidentified: [Inaudible]

Kai Trump: All right. Apparently, I can drive the green, so let's see if I can do it.

Trump: That could make it. That could make the green.

Kai Trump: Hit that dead straight.

Trump: Close. That's going to be good, honey.

Unidentified: You're on. You re ten feet.

Kai Trump: All right. You guys heard that.

Trump: That's going to make the. Preen pretty good, huh?

Kai Trump: Not as good as you.

Trump: You hit that ball good, right?

Kai Trump: Yeah, I hit that right --

Trump: If you hit it good, you can make the green. It's drivable. And you have to be very straight because if you go a little left or right, you have a long trap shot, which is not the favorite shot in rough.

Kai Trump: No. I m not -- I'm not a huge --

Trump: That's on the green.

Kai Trump: Yeah. I'm not a huge fan of fairway bunkers. Do you like -- I hate fairway bunkers. Do you like fairway bunkers?

Trump: No.

Kai Trump: Yeah. I m not -- I've never been a good fairway --

Trump: I prefer not. It's -- it's actually not that tough a shot, but I prefer not.

Kai Trump: Good shot. Come on.

Trump: Hey, I'll give you -- I'll give you a good line.

Kai Trump: Give me a good read.

Trump: I thought that was better than that. I thought that was a little bit better.

Kai Trump: Honestly, I thought that was good.

Trump: See, that has to spin back. Oh, I see. It's not going to spin uphill though. OK, sweetheart. Let's go get them. Come on.

Kai Trump: You got to give me a line.

Trump: Two putt. That's all we want.

Kai Trump: I was just too good. I just drove it over the green on a par four.

Unidentified: That's pretty -- that was a really good hit. Not much [Inaudible].

Kai Trump: Feeling myself. I'm feeling good.

Unidentified: Two cups left.

Trump: Well, you see how it goes.

Kai Trump: Yeah. It goes straight that way. Yeah.

Trump: Boy, that's a lot more than two cups. Aim -- aim like three feet left. Well, it goes -- it's a big break. So, you know what? Aim it right there, honey.

Kai Trump: Yeah, I'm going to go straight in.

Trump: Oh.

Kai Trump: Just like that. Let's go.

Trump: That's great.

Kai Trump: All right.

Trump: That's great.

Kai Trump: Thank you, guys. Thank you, everyone.

Trump: That's very good. OK. I think that gets -- that gets us under par.

Kai Trump: Yeah. Yeah. One under par right there.

Trump: That was a good second par.

Kai Trump: Thank you.

Trump: They gave you a bad read on the first one.

Kai Trump: I think the first one, it was a little -- it's a little more and then more speed. I didn't hit it hard enough. Let's see.

Trump: 117

Kai Trump: Good shot.

Trump: OK. So, it's 120.

Unidentified: Pretty good.

Trump: OK.

Kai Trump: Thank you. We re a lot closer than I thought --

Trump: No, I thought I had a good one. I came all the way back. Where -- where am I? Here?

Unidentified: Right here.

Kai Trump: All right. Perfect. Go in.

Trump: Pretty good.

Kai Trump: All right.

Unidentified: [Inaudible]

Kai Trump: Was that nine holes already or?

Note: [Crosstalk]

Kai Trump: Oh, grandpa, this is number nine.

Unidentified: Let's go. That's awesome.

Kai Trump: We're just too much on a roll. You want you want to do more?

Trump: Yeah.

Kai Trump: All right. Let's do more.

Trump: Yeah, that was a good putt, sweetie. That was a beauty actually. You hit it hard, didn't play the break too much. What is it?

Kai Trump: A bug flew in my ear.

Trump: Wow! Was that -- was that the bug?

Kai Trump: Yeah.

Trump: Did it come our?

Kai Trump: Yeah, it came out. Like it was a big bug. It was almost like a dragonfly.

Trump: Wow! That's weird.

Kai Trump: What's your favorite major out of the year?

Trump: Uh, I love them all, and I also love the Ryder Cup, and I really like the Presidents Cup too but.

Kai Trump: Yeah.

Trump: The Ryder Cup is great, but I love them all. Any major I love.

Kai Trump: I agree.

Trump: Always tough to differentiate, right? You see the flag up there? Thank you. All right, honey. Right there. That same location.

Kai Trump: All right.

Trump: Got that good.

Kai Trump: Yeah. Right down the middle. Just like that.

Trump: [Inaudible]

Kai Trump: I like I like your cart because it always goes extra fast.

Trump: These carts are very fast.

Kai Trump: They're very fast.

Trump: My carts are very fast.

Kai Trump: There you go.

Trump: OK. Good shot.

Kai Trump: Not bad for the line. Oh, I lost my ride. All right. Well, so far -- thank you. This honestly might have been or is so far my favorite video I've ever filmed I think. I think it's just kind of cool like filming -- filming with my grandpa. Obviously, he's president of the United States, but to me, he's just my grandpa. But it s -- I've had a lot of fun filming this video. I've enjoyed it a lot. I'm also playing good, so I think that's why I'm enjoying it a lot more too.

Trump: Good putt. Good putt.

Kai Trump: Ooh. Ah.

Trump: Ah. You're up right. You want to play a full round?

Kai Trump: Do you want -- do you want to?

Trump: I don't mind. We're doing fine. We're moving fast.

Kai Trump: We re moving fast. I'll be --

Trump: We're not bothering anybody, right? Want to play a full?

Kai Trump: Yeah, sure.

Trump: OK. Well, that way we have a score because you can play nine, they think something's wrong with you. If you only play nine, they'll say, oh, is there something wrong with him?

Kai Trump: Nothing's wrong with us.

Trump: Nothing's wrong -- nobody can play golf like that and have something wrong.

Kai Trump: We're -- we -- we've been playing -- what? That was ten? So, now we're going on to 11.

Trump: Yeah, well, it's called talent.

Kai Trump: In under an hour, and we're one under.

Trump: Thank you everybody. Thank you. Your taxes are coming down. See, everyone's happy, honey.

Kai Trump: That's awesome.

Trump: We've done a good job. Run through the nine holes.

Kai Trump: Exactly.

Trump: Beautiful state.

Kai Trump: Very, very nice.

Trump: Nice place, huh?

Kai Trump: Yeah. I like the architecture and the buildings a lot. It's beautiful.

Trump: It's a good place, baby. That's good. Good. Thank you. Thank you. Go.

Unidentified: It's over. Turn left.

Trump: It's going to be OK. Not bad. A little pushy.

Kai Trump: A little pushy, but not too pushy.

Trump: Nope.

Kai Trump: Is there a dream that you're still trying to chase, or have you reached all your dreams?

Trump: You're asking questions like you're a television company. I thought I was just going to come out and play a round of golf with you. And I'm --

Kai Trump: I'm --

Trump: You're asking questions like I'm -- like I'm on television. Yeah, no. Look, you become president. That's a dream, right?

Kai Trump: Yeah. I don't think you can --

Trump: Now, where you can -- you dream now you want to be a great president.

Kai Trump: Yeah.

Trump: You're president. Now your dream is to be a great president.

Kai Trump: I think you're doing a pretty good job.

Trump: I don't think I'll ever play golf any better than I play. It's pretty good, right? OK.

Kai Trump: That's true.

Trump: Where are you, honey?

Kai Trump: Down there.

Trump: She OK? Yeah.

Kai Trump: Yeah, I'm good.

Trump: OK. Beautiful hole, right?

Kai Trump: Very beautiful. I like the American flag in the back too.

Trump: Nice shot. It's going to be very nice. Very safe.

Kai Trump: Faded it a little too much.

Trump: That's all right. That's a good shot.

Kai Trump: That's a really good shot.

Unidentified: Nice swing.

Kai Trump: That was legit.

Trump: You could tell by the noise, right, honey?

Kai Trump: Yeah. Well, the ball flight too.

Trump: Yeah, you can tell -- you can always tell by the noise.

Kai Trump: The noise, yeah.

Trump: When you hear that noise, you say, oh, that's a good shot.

Kai Trump: When you hear a chunk noise, no ball, just grass.

Trump: When you hear a clank, that's no good.

Kai Trump: That's not good.

Trump: I think you're in the two.

Kai Trump: I'm in the bunker.

Trump: Ooh.

Kai Trump: So, it's going to be an interesting shot. I got that. Nice little 60.

Trump: Almost. You didn't quite climb the hill.

Kai Trump: I thought I actually hit that pretty good. Go in. All right. You got the par.

Unidentified: Here we go.

Trump: Not bad. We got our par.

Kai Trump: Like baseball. Look at that. All right, that's a bogey. Not great. on to the next one for me. Par though. Team wise, we're still one under. One under, guys.

Trump: That was a good par.

Kai Trump: Yeah, it was good.

Trump: That's a good chip.

Unidentified: Very good.

Trump: A little tough back, you know, with the grass behind it. That guy's a really good player. He does -- you know, he's just -- he's really a good player. You got to -- I mean, someone year-round -- his short game is phenomenal. Take a little short game action, you know? His short game is so good. But short game, you almost have to learn to play for yourself.

Kai Trump: Short game I think is all -- you figure that out yourself.

Trump: Well, you have to have it genetically.

Kai Trump: You knew -- well, you need also to know the basics, but once you get the basics, I feel like you can learn a lot by yourself. Good shot.

Trump: That got over?

Kai Trump: Yeah.

Trump: That good?

Unidentified: Yeah. Perfect.

Trump: OK, honey. We're playing so fast.

Kai Trump: We're doing good, though.

Trump: We're going right through the members. They're so good. They're letting us just go right through.

Kai Trump: I know.

Trump: I hit that solid two. It's right there, right?

Unidentified: Yeah. Just in front.

Kai Trump: You're good. Good shot.

Trump: Good shot. Good shot. That's a beauty. That's a stinger, right?

Kai Trump: Stinger -- stinger five iron.

Trump: It's a Tiger shot. You've been hanging out with Tiger. That was a Tiger -- low stinger. That wasn't going to move an inch.

Kai Trump: That was a good shot.

Trump: I thought I had a good shot.

Kai Trump: There's a lot of wind. That's why I stung it. If I hit it high, it would've got caught up in the air.

Trump: Yours was beautiful.

Kai Trump: Eagle putt.

Trump: Yeah. Where are you? Right there? Good.

Kai Trump: Yeah. For eagle.

Trump: That's good. OK.

Kai Trump: Good shot. Really good shot. There you go. All right. Let's make this for eagle. Let's get a good read on this. Yeah.

Unidentified : [Inaudible]

Kai Trump: It's going to turn a lot.

Unidentified: Yeah.

Kai Trump: Ooh.

Trump: Put -- put it in, honey. OK. Put it yours in.

Kai Trump: Two under. This might be my favorite golf course.

Trump: It was a good birdie.

Kai Trump: Thank you. Appreciate it. I've been working a lot more playing holes and stuff like that than on the range, and it's paying off.

Trump: See, this is your back tee from here, honey.

Kai Trump: Yeah.

Trump: It's 510. So, you got to hit -- well, the long hitters go left. Very few people get that. You got to go over the trap, but most people play that. Nobody plays back there. Let me put it differently.

Kai Trump: But for -- for a US Open, back there would be amazing. You can t get on -- with the river and stuff like, you can't get much more of a better venue.

Trump: This course would be so tough, honey. For anybody. It s a great hole. So, are you impressed by the course? because you never saw the course. I can't believe it.

Kai Trump: My first time. It's beautiful, though. You did honestly amazing job. It's all going downhill.

Trump: One of the best courses anywhere.

Kai Trump: Very beautiful. Good shot. There you go. Oh, stop spinning.

Trump: Go.

Kai Trump: No Over?

Trump: If you're over, you're good. I think you are.

Kai Trump: I don't know. I spun that. It went over?

Unidentified: It just got over but [Inaudible].

Kai Trump: Oh, all right.

Trump: All right. If you're over it, it's fine.

Kai Trump: That was the worst shot I hit today.

Trump: Two under, honey. Not bad.

Kai Trump: Good job.

Trump: Huh?

Kai Trump: I said great job. We're doing good.

Trump: Yep. We're moving fast.

Kai Trump: But that's good though, you know. Nothing's worse than waiting like hours on the course for people to hit. Don't you agree?

Trump: I agree.

Kai Trump: Yeah, I spun that way too much.

Trump: Good shot.

Kai Trump: Thank you. Good shot. Really good shot. There you go.

Trump: Stay there?

Kai Trump: Yeah.

Trump: That was -- that was solid, right?

Kai Trump: That was good.

Trump: That was pretty, wasn't it?

Kai Trump: That was good. Really good. My bunker shot, I couldn't hit anything more than eight iron because of the -- I hit nine iron because of the -- the -- the lip. But I hit a good shot out, so now I m --

Trump: You hit a very good --

Kai Trump: I got a chip and then -- see how far this is. 50.

Unidentified: [Inaudible]. It's not much.

Trump: Get up.

Kai Trump: That was a mid shot. That's what we call mid. Like, that was just like -- it was like OK. Hit it well. Didn't happen but like just a mid shot. I got to drain that putt now. One thing about these courses is I love how the grass just kind of like flies off. Like, it doesn't feel any grain or anything like that.

Trump: Put it in. Good put. Good putt.

Kai Trump: All right.

Unidentified: Go in.

Kai Trump: Ooh. Good shot.

Trump: All right, honey. Put it up. Whoop. Get up. Get up. It's all right.

Kai Trump: Oh, wow. It spun back.

Trump: It's all right.

Kai Trump: All right. I'll chip that.

Trump: Little fat. I'm in good shape. I think you're fine.

Kai Trump: No, you're good. Just make that par. Birdie two.

Trump: Yeah.

Kai Trump: Oh. Well.

Trump: Almost.

Kai Trump: All right. Par. I don't even need to bring this out. He got us a par. I'm not willing to make that putt. I'll save this for when I actually need to make it in. OK. There you go.

Unidentified: Feeling good right now?

Kai Trump: Yeah. We're feeling good. Two under on 14 -- just finish 14, going 15, I'm feeling good. Juices are flowing. Feel good. There you go, partner.

Trump: Yep.

Kai Trump: That was good.

Trump: OK, honey. Keep it at two under.

Kai Trump: This is beautiful.

Trump: Right?

Kai Trump: So beautiful.

Trump: That bridge is the oldest bridge in the United States.

Kai Trump: Oh, really? Oh, wow.

Trump: We'll play up here, right?

Kai Trump: Yeah.

Trump: It's a long haul.

Kai Trump: There you go.

Trump: Thank you.

Kai Trump: Good job, partner. I hit that one good.

Trump: Yep.

Kai Trump: Do you prefer fades or cuts -- or sorry. Sorry. Fades or draws?

Trump: So, I really play sort of both. If -- if -- if I'm hitting it good -- if I fade, I hit it a little bit left and it fades, and if I hook it, it goes right. I play both.

Kai Trump: Yeah.

Trump: It's like I hit a pretty straight ball.

Kai Trump: It's important to play both though because you have so many more options, especially on when you -- start playing harder courses.

Trump: That way you -- it's just -- it's just -- it's a great way.

Kai Trump: Yeah, I agree.

Trump: I really play pretty straight. OK, let's go, honey. Put it on. Shot. Get up. Very good. Very good, honey.

Kai Trump: Thank you. Not as good as you, but I'm getting there.

Trump” Same in.

Kai Trump: Great shot. Closer than me.

Trump: Yeah, that's a good shot. That was a good shot.

Kai Trump: That was really good shot. You compressed it.

Trump: Compressed.

Kai Trump: Yeah. Like you said, you could hear it from the sound.

Trump: You've got to compress them, honey.

Kai Trump: All right, these are makeable putts.

Trump: Yep. All right. That's a good putt.

Kai Trump: Yeah. Course. Two under. I got last three holes.

Trump: OK. Good. We'll make -- we're going fast.

Kai Trump: We're doing good.

Trump: Next hole is great.

Kai Trump: I mean, they're all -- they're all great.

Trump: Par three. You don't have anything bad. Par three. See how beautiful this is?

Kai Trump: So beautiful.

Trump: The whole thing --

Kai Trump: It's so nice. It just feels like you're -- even though you're in DC --

Trump: The value of this property.

Kai Trump: It feels like you're like in the middle of nowhere if that makes any sense. Like, it's so peaceful.

Trump: 20 minutes from the White House.

Kai Trump: Yeah. It's amazing.

Trump: Hi, fellas. Easy hole. It's all right. Nice shot. That's a good shot, honey.

Kai Trump: All right. There you go. We're good.

Trump: What'd you hit? A seven?

Kai Trump: Seven iron, yeah.

Trump: Go. Go.

Kai Trump: Go.

Trump: Good putt.

Unidentified: Yeah.

Kai Trump: There you go. Never a doubt. All right, we both got pars on this hole.

Trump: Nice to play your first ball. Yeah. Let me just go this way. I'll tell you. These are tricky. You got to be careful. They canb --

Kai Trump: You don't want to turn the wrong way and all of a sudden flip over.

Trump: They can flip, honey. They can flip. I've seen plenty of flips. OK. Good. We saved that.

Kai Trump: Good. That was a good one. I love how the lake goes between the -- like it s -- there's crevices.

Trump: It s one of the greatest courses. Look at this, honey, as you're coming in.

Kai Trump: Beautiful.

Trump: 17

Kai Trump: And then 18 is the waterfall?

Trump: 18 is the waterfall.

Kai Trump: Yeah. That's a -- that's a good finisher.

Trump: Yeah. OK, baby.

Kai Trump: Alright. Good shot.

Trump: We should get a birdie here, baby. This is a par five. We're both reaching.

Kai Trump: I know. We should.

Trump: Bernhard Langer won -- he won the tournament. He played it purposely into this trap to stay out of the water.

Kai Trump: That's what -- that's -- that's what I did. You see, I faded my mine.

Trump: Yeah. It's OK.

Kai Trump: We're both good. You have a better angle than me. 179.

Trump: Put it on, honey.

Kai Trump: What do you think it's playing?

Trump: About 190.

Unidentified: 195

Kai Trump: The thing is I can't hit more than -- I'm going to hit my hybrid. I'll play more on that side just in case. Oh, not a great shot at all.

Trump: Where'd she go?

Unidentified: [Inaudible]

Kai Trump: Alright. Do you want to drop one for me over there?

Unidentified: [Inaudible]

Kai Trump: Yeah.

Trump: You OK?

Kai Trump: I don't know. I did not hit that great.

Trump: I am. I'm good.

Kai Trump: No, you're good. Yeah. You hit yours good. Is that good? Ah, shoot. I do love better when I see the pin. So. Not when I don't see the pin.

Unidentified: Oh, my God. It's unreal.

Kai Trump: Alright. Par -- two under. I thought mine was -- I thought my ball was out, and my ball was actually good over there. I was like hanging on, but I'm glad that I still was able to make par but.

Unidentified: How does it feel playing all 18 with grandpa?

Kai Trump: It feels good honestly, and I'm not tired. Like, since we're moving fast, it doesn't feel like -- like I'm playing a lot if that makes any sense. Like, obviously we're playing 18, but it doesn't feel like 18.

Unidentified: You're killing it.

Kai Trump: Alright.

Trump: OK, baby.

Kai Trump: Let's get a birdie on the last hole.

Trump: Boy, I thought I had that birdie.

Kai Trump: I thought you had it too.

Trump: Didn't you think so?

Kai Trump: I thought so. I got lucky, and my ball was safe over there.

Trump: That's the back tee. 519. This would be such a great tournament course. Hi. Hey, how are you? You look good. One hole. Come on.

Kai Trump: All right. We got --

Trump: Let's see if we can get one more birdie. Hi, fellas.

Kai Trump: Wow. What a nice hole.

Trump: Beautiful, isn't it beautiful?

Kai Trump: Beautiful. Hole 18. Grandpa hits, and I hit. Let's do this. Good shot.

Trump: It's alright. There's your best shot of the day. That's your best swing today.

Kai Trump: [Inaudible]

Trump: Down the pipe, honey.

Kai Trump: I'm good.

Trump: Alright. Let's go, baby. We got to make a birdie.

Kai Trump: Let's do this.

Trump: Oh. So, what -- look at the land. Even if you see that for a couple of years -- you might see that -- [Inaudible].

Kai Trump: Oh, wow. Really?

Trump: You know when you [Inaudible] see it for a little while. Look at what you find. You can't give that up. You can do the same thing by putting it border, and in two or three years, it's -- wow.

Unidentified: 84

Trump: That was a little fat.

Kai Trump: Good shot. No, no. It was perfect.

Trump: That s good.

Kai Trump: Maybe a little long, honestly. Alright.

Trump: Go. Oh.

Kai Trump: Go in. Go in. Oh. Great putt.

Trump: Boy, that looked good for a long time.

Unidentified: [Inaudible]

Kai Trump: On the left.

Trump: Maybe. Nope. OK, honey, pick it up. We got to par. Good playing. Good playing, honey.

Kai Trump: Thank you.

Trump: Good play.

Kai Trump: Thank you.

Trump: She's a good player.

Kai Trump: All right. Well, thank you guys so much for watching. I had a great time. It was a great time with you and, um, stay tuned for the next one and, um, yeah. Until next time.

Trump: We had a good time. We both played well. I think we played well. Yeah, we played well.

Kai Trump: We did OK.

Trump: Pretty good. Hit a lot of good shots, and it was nice, and we shot a pretty good score, right?

Kai Trump: Yeah. No. And thanks so much for coming on the channel.

Trump: She's a great player, this one. Thank you.
