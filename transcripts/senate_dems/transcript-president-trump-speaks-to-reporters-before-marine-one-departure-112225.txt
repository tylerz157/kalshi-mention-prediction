Question: Mr. President –

President Donald Trump: We're going to Andrews Air Force Base to do some work, especially for our great Air Force. We're doing some fix-up of the base, which it needs. Uh, we're gonna try and re-institute the golf courses. I'm meeting with the great Jack Nicklaus, greatest, uh, person. And he's involved in trying to bring their, uh, recreational facility back with a great place that has been destroyed over the years through lack of maintenance. So we'll fix that up and Jack will be the architect and he'll design it. Two existing courses that are in very bad shape so we can, for very little money, fix it up for the Air Force base. And we're looking at other things over at Andrews, so we're gonna be stopping. Won't be too long. We'll be stopping over there. I think some of you will be there.

And, uh, the economy, as you saw some incredible numbers came in, investment in our country is bigger than ever before by a factor of two or three. And uh, that means a lot of things are being built and a lot of plans will be opening very soon.

Question: Mr. President. Senator, Senator Graham –

Question: I know that before you had an, uh, a fight with Elon Musk and you guys were able to work it out. Will we see the same –

Trump : No, I get along with everybody.

Question: Will we see the same thing happening between you and Congresswoman Taylor Grenne?

Trump: Sure. Why not? I mean, I get along with everybody.

Question: Is this your final offer to Ukraine?

Trump: No, not my final.

Question: Sir, do you still plan... Sir, do you still—

Trump: I would like to get the peace. It should have been, it should have happened a long time ago.

Trump: The Ukraine war with Russia should have never happened. If I were president, it never would've happened.

Question: Sir.

Trump: We're trying to get it ended. One way or the other, we have to get it ended. So-

Trump: Then he can continue, then he can continue to fight his little heart out.

Question: Sir, do you still have plans --

Trump: Say it.

Question: Do you have any comments about Bolsonaro's arrest, former Brazilian president?

Trump: So I spoke last night to the gentleman you just referred to, and we're gonna be meeting, I believe, in the very near future.

Question: Sir, are you willing to [Inaudible] arrested today?

Trump: What?

Question: Of any comment about the former Brazilian president being arrested today?

Trump: No, I don't know anything about that.

Question: Sir, are you willing... Sir, sir.

Trump: I haven't.

Question: Mr. President, are you willing-

Trump: I didn't hear. Is that what happened? It's too bad.

Question: Do you have any comment?

Trump: That's too bad. No, I just think it's too bad.

Question: Do you still plan to deploy the national guard to New York City?

Question: Do you still plan to deploy the National guard to New York City?

Trump: If they need it. Right now, other places needed more, but if they need it. We had a very good meeting yesterday. We talked about that. Uh, but if they need it, I would do it.

Question: Mr. President, are you willing, are you willing to forgive Congresswoman Taylor Greene?

Trump: Forgive for what? No, we just, I just disagreed with her philosophy. Uh, she started backing perhaps the worst Republican congressman in our history. This, this, you know, stupid person named Bassey. And, uh, I said, "Go your own way." And once I left her, she resigned because she would've, she would never have survived a primary. But I think she's a nice person. Okay. Thank you.
