President Trump : So I'm going to Davos. I believe it'll be very successful. The trip, the country's never done better. We have $18 billion plus coming in. We've never had anything like it. And no country has had anything like it. Prices are way down. Uh, gasoline now is $1.99 in a lot of places. And frankly, uh, nobody's seen anything like this. So it's really good. But this will be an interesting trip. I have no idea what's gonna happen but you are well represented. Thank you very much everyone.

Question: How was the Erdogan call? How was the Erdogan call, sir?

Trump: It was a very good call.
