President Trump: So we had a great visit at Fort Bragg. We saw a lot of heroes, and as you probably heard, we're going to be giving one particular person the Congressional Medal of Honor for what just took place in Venezuela, and met a lot of people right now. We were there for quite a while, and it was beautiful. These are great warriors. These are great patriots, and they're in very good shape. I will tell you that.

Question : What -- what can Iran do to avoid attack?

Trump : Give us the deal that they should have given us the first time. They give us the right deal, we won't do that. But, you know, historically, they haven't done that. They -- I will say they want to talk, but so far, they do a lot of talking and no action.

Question : When are those talks, Mr. President? When are those talks?

Trump : They've already started.

Question : Do you want regime change in Iran?

Trump : Well, it seems like that would be the best thing that could happen. For 47 years, they've been talking and talking and talking, and in the meantime, we've lost a lot of lives while they talk, and legs blown off, arms blown off, faces blown off. It's been going on for a long time. So let's see what happens. In the meantime, we have --

Question : [Inaudible]

Trump : -- meantime, we have tremendous power has arrived, and additional power. As you know, another carrier is going out shortly. So we'll see how -- if we could get it settled for once and for all, that would be good.

Question : Who would you want to take over?

Trump : What?

Question : Who would you want to take over?

Trump : I don't want to talk about that. There are people --

Question : -- Mr. President, have you spoken to Secretary Duffy since Wednesday's incident?

Trump : Oh, no, he's doing a great job.

Question : You said inside that the Iranian nuclear sites have been totally obliterated. What's left to go after?

Trump : Well, you could get whatever the dust is down there. Uh, that's really the least of the mission. If we do it, that would be the least of the mission. But we'd, you know, probably grab whatever's -- whatever's left. It has been obliterated, as you know.

Question : Would you accept anything less than zero nuclear enrichment?

Trump : I don't -- we don't want any enrichment.

Question : Mr. President --

Trump : -- We don't want enrichment. Thank you very much, everybody.
