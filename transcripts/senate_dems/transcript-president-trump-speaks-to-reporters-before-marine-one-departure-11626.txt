Question : Thank you, Mr. President. Can you explain how you view, you know, your great -- your Great Healthcare Plan will impact Americans' health insurance premiums?

President Trump: It's going to be a tremendous -- it is a tremendous plan. It's called the Great Healthcare Plan, and we're going to get tremendous, uh reductions, as you know, through, uh, if you look at, uh, medicines and prescription drugs, they're going to come down by numbers that have never been seen before. And we're doing that by Most Favored Nations, other nations whoever pays the lowest in the world, that's what we're going to pay.

Trump : Right now, we're paying sometimes ten times higher than other nations. So we have Favored Nations. Uh, that's been approved. Other nations have, for the most part, agreed to it and they had no choice. Otherwise, we were going to put tariffs on them. So the healthcare plan that we're coming, the money is going to be paid directly to the people. So it goes directly, not to the companies, not to the insurance companies, it's going to go directly to the people and the people are going to buy their own healthcare. They'll get much better health care at a much reduced [Inaudible]

Question : -- pull out of NATO if it doesn't help you acquire Greenland, if it doesn't [Inaudible] --

Trump : Well, we're going to see. NATO has been dealing with us on Greenland. We need Greenland for national security, very badly. If we don't have it, we have a big hole in national security, especially when it comes to what we're doing in terms of the Golden Dome and all of the other things. We have a lot of -- a lot of investments in military. We have got the strongest military in the world and it's only getting stronger. And you saw that with Venezuela. You saw that with the attack on Iran, with the knocking out their nuclear capability potentially. So, uh, yeah, we're going to -- we're talking to NATO. We're talking --

Question : Prime Minister Carney is in China. How do you see the deals Canada and China have just signed trade deals between the two partners?

Trump : Well, it's OK. That's what he should be doing. I mean, it's a good thing for him to sign a trade deal. If you can get a deal with China, you should do that.

Question : -- election in Venezuela?

Trump : No.

Question : Did Arab and Israeli officials convince you to not strike Iran?

Trump : Nobody convinced me. I convinced myself. You had yesterday, scheduled over 800 hangings. They didn't hang anyone. They canceled the hangings. That had a big impact.

Question : President Trump? President Trump? Yesterday -- yesterday, you accepted Maria Machado's Nobel Prize medal. What do you intend to do with it? And why would you want someone else's Nobel Prize?

Trump : Well, she offered it to me. I thought it was very nice. She said, you know, you've added eight wars and nobody deserves this prize more than -- in history, than you do. And I thought it was a very nice gesture. And by the way, I think she's a very fine woman and we'll be talking again.

Trump : Say it.

Question : What's the trigger for the Insurrection Act in Minnesota? What are you waiting for?

Trump : Well, the Insurrection Act, which has been used by 48 percent of the presidents as of this moment, uh, the Insurrection Act also, uh, if you look at it, I believe it was Bush, the elder Bush, uh, he used it, I think 28 times. Uh, it's been used a lot. And if I needed it, I'd use it. I don't think there's any reason right now to use it. But if I needed it, I'd use it. It's, uh, very powerful.

Question : -- a very nice person. You said the meeting went well. Why align with Delcy Rodriguez and the remnants of the Maduro regime and not with Machado, who has the support of the Venezuelan people?

Trump : Well, if you ever, uh, remember a place called Iraq, where everybody was fired, every single person, the police, the generals, everybody was fired and they ended up being ISIS. Instead of just getting down to business, they ended up being ISIS. So I remember that. But I'll tell you, I had a great meeting yesterday by a person who I have a lot of respect for and she has respect, obviously, for me and our country. And she gave me her Nobel Prize. But I'll tell you what, uh, I got to know her. I never met her before and I was very, very impressed. She's a really -- this is a fine woman.

Question : The March for Life is next week.

Trump : Yes.

Question : And some pro-lifers are worried about your support for the Hyde Amendment. What do you tell them?

Trump : Well, you know what I tell them, uh, you're going to hear about it because I just taped a beautiful piece for them and they're going to play it. And those are great people. I want to tell you, they're great people. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, everybody.
