President Donald Trump: OK. Happy Halloween and all of that. So we had an amazing trip. We had incredible meetings with President Xi of China, as you know, with the brilliant new prime minister of Japan. we just had a great time and with the president of South Korea. We had an amazing journey. We also saw a lot of other countries. We brought back home with us trillions of dollars, trillions, many trillions of dollars and our country is doing well. The shutdown proceeds because the Democrats just don't know what they're doing. I don't know what's wrong with them. They've never done a thing like this. They've become crazed lunatics. All they have to do is say, let's go, let's open up our country and everything snaps back into shape. So there's something wrong with them.

Question : Mr. President, are you going to meet with Democratic leaders [Inaudible]

Trump: I'm always going to meet. All they have to do is open up the country. Let them open up the country and we'll meet. We'll meet very quickly, but they have to open up the country. It's their fault. Everything is their fault. It's so easily solved. We have a number of Democrats that have already voted for this, but the Republicans, they're very unified. They're very strong and they want to do what's right for the country. They don't want to see trillions of dollars wasted on people that came into our country illegally, many from prisons and many from areas that you don't want to even know about. So we'd like to see this taken care of rapidly. You have a lot of -- we have tremendous support, but it's not even support, it's commonsense open up the country. Obamacare has turned out to be a disaster. as I've been saying for years. It can be fixed or redone. People don't get good health care and their premiums go up every single year. So we should change it. It's a disaster. Obamacare is bad health care at a very high price. So --

Question: ,Would you like to see a deal to extend --

Trump: -- tonight, we have a big celebration of Halloween and I'll see you later. Thank you very much.
