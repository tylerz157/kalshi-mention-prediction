================================================================================

President Trump: Well, thank you very much, Jack and hello New Jersey, special place. You know that I stay there all the time. I live there a lot and, uh, it's been a very, very incredible, uh, place to be as far as I'm concerned. But we're less than 24 hours away from the start of early voting in the very important primary election to select your Republican candidate for governor.

It's a big deal. It's being watched actually all over the world, 'cause New Jersey's ready to pop out of that blue, uh, horror show and really get in there and vote for somebody that's gonna make things happen. I'm asking you to get out and vote for a true champion for the people of your state, Jack Ciattarelli.

He's been a friend of mine and, uh, he's been a real success story. Early voting starts tomorrow at 1000 A.M. and then Sunday at 6:00 P.M. So get out and vote tomorrow morning or anytime this week, or make a plan to vote at least on election day. That's another way of doing it. A lot of people like doing it that way best, I sort of do. But vote on election day Tuesday, June 10th. That's June 10th, this year's election for governor's critical for New Jersey's future.

You'll decide whether New Jersey is a high tax, high crime stat, sanctuary state, if you can believe it. A sanctuary state. Nobody wants sanctuary states, including Democrats actually. But it's, uh, very, very, uh, much into that mode and we can't let that happen with crippling regulations and rampant corruption or whether Jack Ciattarelli makes the garden state affordable and family friendly and safe and you know, it's like Make America Great Again.

It's Make New Jersey Great Again. The radical left Democrats of the race are woke, literally lunatics who want New Jersey to be a haven for illegal alien gang members, human traffickers, dangerous criminals of all kinds, including murderers who have been let into our country by Biden and his group of people with their open border craziness, we're taking care of it. As you probably heard, we had the safest border in history over the last three months, 99.999%. And if you get four more years with somebody that, uh, you've been going through.

I mean, it's just so sad. Your taxes go up, you crush the middle class families and cause mass exodus, j- -- e- --and that's happened. Mass exodus of jobs and businesses all throughout the state while they indoctrinate your children at a public school. It's a terrible thing that happens to the children. Uh, you, you look here at all, it's like called transgender for all and we've ended that.

New Jersey's economy will wither and die and you'll be living in a nightmare of chaos and crime and you sort of have that to a certain extent now, but it's gonna be changed and it's gonna be changed fast with Jack. So Jack is the most experienced and battle tested candidate in the race. He previously served as the Raritan Borough Council president, Somerset County Commissioner, an Assemblyman for New Jersey 16th District.

Respected by everybody in each of these roles. Jack's fought and he fought hard to lower your taxes, deliver relief to New Jersey businesses, a very big tax cutter. He's also a successful entrepreneur who actually knows how to balance a budget and he always seems to be able to balance a budget. Jack will lock in a 1% property tax cap, something so important.

Crackdown on [Inaudible] criminals. Liberate New Jersey from illegal alien gangs and savage criminal networks and give your police support. And we love our police, but they have to have the support and respect that they deserve. Jack will fight the scourge of anti-Semitism, secure New Jersey's elections with voter ID and the radical left war on the suburbs and fight New York's ridiculous congestion pricing scheme that costs com- -- commuters thousands and thousands of dollars.

And, uh, nobody understands why that happened and how that was allowed to happen. He'll also stand up to radical teachers unions and champion quality education and teachers that, uh, really do the job. He's gonna take care of them because there's nothing better, nothing more valuable. This is one of the truly cherished groups anywhere in the world as far as I'm concerned.

So kids are gonna learn to read, to write, and to love America. So Jack has what it takes to win. He is my complete and total endorsement. Other people are going around saying I endorse them. That's not true. Jack Ciattarelli has my complete and total endorsement. With your help, Jack will have an incredible victory in November and make New Jersey great again.

Remember, early voting starts tomorrow in the primary and then you get out and you vote and, uh, you're gonna vote, uh, I think at levels that haven't been seen before in New Jersey. It closes on Sunday and then you go back on election day. If you haven't been able to, you go back election day, which is Tuesday, June 10th, so go out and vote for it. Jack Ciattarelli, he's really a great guy.

He's never gonna let you down. And with that Jack, I can't do any better than that, Jack. So you get out there and win [Laughter] and you take it over.
