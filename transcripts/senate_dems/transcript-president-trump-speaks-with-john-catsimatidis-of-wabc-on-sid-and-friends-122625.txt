John Catsimatidis: One second, I've got President Trump on the phone.

Unidentified : Oh, hold on.

Catsimatidis : Mr. President?

President Trump: I had to save that attack for Christmas Day. Do you agree?

Catsimatidis : I agree, I am in the studio right now broadcasting to a million people.

Trump : Oh, wow! That's great.

Catsimatidis : Would you like to say hello to them?

Trump : Yes, I will, but I have to go quick because I have China --

Note: [Crosstalk]

Catsimatidis : We'll do it right now. You've got China on the other line. President Trump is on the line. Mr. President, say hello to a million people for WABC.

Trump : Millions, millions and millions, knowing how successful your show is. They all love listening to John and his great wisdom. That's good.

Catsimatidis : And President Trump, like I said to you, to save those Christian lives in Africa because there's so many Christians losing their lives and you did a great job.

Trump : Tens of thousands of Christians. And I told Nigeria, and I told the people around Nigeria, that if you do it, you're going to get hit. And I said yesterday, I said hit him on Christmas Day. It'll be a Christmas present. We hit ISIS who are terrible; they're butchers and we really hit them hard in different locations. And they really got hit hard yesterday, so they got a very bad Christmas present.

Catsimatidis : And I've told people that Maduro, Venezuela, and Venezuela is going to provide a lot more oil to the United States of America if Maduro leaves.

Trump : Well, it's about a lot of things, it's about that. It's about -- you know, they took our oil, they took it, and they also sent millions of people in there from jails into our country from jails, some of the worst people on earth, Tren de Aragua. They emptied their jails into the United States. As you know, they sailed -- they sent drugs in. And I don't know if you know, John, but drug traffic is down by sea now 97.2 percent.

Note: [Crosstalk]

Catsimatidis : Wow. I know -- nobody understands, Mr. President, that -- why the Democrats are objecting to knocking out those boats that are carrying drugs that are going to kill our people.

Trump : Well, they're only objecting because I'm the one doing it. If it were anybody else, even another Republican -- let's say you take a weak Republican, they would say that's all right, because they have Trump Derangement Syndrome. They're sick people, there's something wrong with them. But every time I knock out a boat, we save 25,000 American lives.

It's very simple. And what's happening is they're having a hard time -- employment wise they can't get anybody. And we just knocked out -- I don't know if you read or you saw, they have a big plant or a big facility where they send the -- you know, where the ships come from, two nights ago, we knocked that out. So, we hit them very hard. But drugs are down over 97 percent. Can you believe it?

Catsimatidis : That is -- I mean, you have done a miracle for all Americans. I mean, you're bringing down -- you brought down the price of gasoline tremendously. You've brought down interest rates. I mean --

Trump : Gasoline is down much more than they even say, because in California -- you know, if it goes down, they just take more tax. You know, they raise the tax. If it goes down $0.05, they raise the tax 5 percent. We're down to $2 in many states. We're under $2 a gallon in many states. It's like a massive -- it's like a really big tax cut what we've done with gasoline and gasoline and energy generally is way down.

And also with energy, as you know, because it's such a big -- and you're very successful at it, John. You are so big at it and you're so knowledgeable, you know, when you get energy down everything comes down. It's just there is no second factor that's even close.

Catsimatidis : And I've said --

Trump : And if you bring down the cost of energy, everything comes down. All prices are coming down after four years of Biden.

Catsimatidis : And it's another way of breaking up President Putin because, if the price of oil is coming down to the low 50s and he's still selling it at a discount, Russia is going to go broke.

Trump : Well, it doesn't help him, that I can tell you, you know, it's not exactly helpful. I think we're making some progress on that front. We ended eight wars and have one more to go and that one I thought would have been an easy one because I do get along well with them but has not turned out to be the easiest; it's turned out to be the toughest.

We ended eight including India and Pakistan who were really going at it. That was going to be -- the prime minister of Pakistan said President Trump saved 10 million lives at least. So, I think we did, but I'm going to get the other one. I think we're going to get some good news on the other one.

Catsimatidis : We just got some breaking news that you're having Zelenskyy at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday. And I said, I mean, you work seven days a week, I mean you -- including Christmas.

Trump : No, I work about the same hours as you do, which is all the time. I think, I don't know, we'll have a contest for who works longer hours and who works harder. And then we'll also have a contest for who works smarter, because I work smarter. I hear you're very smart.

Catsimatidis : Well, you know, I once told you I follow you.

Trump : Okay, John, well you're great.

Catsimatidis : Thank you.

Trump : It's great that I got your show. You know, for the people listening, I called up just to thank John, he said some nice things about me. I end up being on a radio show, but that's OK.

Catsimatidis : All right. Thank you so much.

Trump : Take care, John.

Catsimatidis : President Trump, great to talk to you. We'll tell Sid you said hello as well, or he's going to be jealous that you called in without him.

Trump : Sid is the greatest, I'll tell you. Isn't he great? You have a great guy. Don't lose him, John, don't lose him, OK?

Catsimatidis : Merry Christmas. Thank you so much and thank you for doing a great job for America.

Trump : Thank you, John. Merry Christmas. So long.

Unidentified : Merry Christmas, Mr. President.

Catsimatidis : Thank you.

Trump : So long, fellas.

Catsimatidis : Bye-bye.
