Unidentified : Anyway, also that this --

President Trump: It's very conducive to deals. Are you OK? Is everyone fine? Margaret, if you would, I think you could sit outside and have some food. Would you like to have some food or do you consider that a bribe, and therefore you cannot write honestly -- or therefore you have to write a bad story? OK, because if you'd like, would you like something to eat at this time? Yes or no? You can speak.

Unidentified: Yes, sir.

Trump : Yes. OK. Margo, take them outside, tell the chef, serve them a little lunch, OK?

Aide : Thank you, press.
