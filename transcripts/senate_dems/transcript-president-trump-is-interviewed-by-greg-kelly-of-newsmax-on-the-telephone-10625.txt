================================================================================

Greg Kelly: And actually, I understand that we have the president of the United States on the phone with us right now. President Trump, welcome. How are you tonight?

President Donald Trump: I'm very good. I'm very good and I love watching your show. And when you said could you do it? I said I'm a little busy, but in your case, I'm going to do it, absolutely.

Kelly: Well, you certainly are busy, and we know you've got literally the weight of the world on your shoulders. Hey, first off, if you don't mind, the Schumer shutdown, are you making progress? What do you expect? I heard the experts say it should be over this week.

Trump: Well, I guess we're making progress, you know, look, they should have never shut it down. We have the best economy in the world right now, nobody's even close and they shouldn't have done it. But they're out of control. They're controlled by the radical left people and it's just so ridiculous. So, yeah, I guess we're making progress. A lot of people want to get it done. You know, they want to spend their money on open borders, they want to spend their money on all the things that you don't want to spend money on. And you know what they've done with health care is a disaster. I mean what they've done with health care is just an absolute disaster the way they waste money. So, it's just one of those things, but I guess the answer is I think it's moving in that direction.

Kelly: So, Governor Pritzker on TV today says he doesn't want to call you because he thinks he'll have legal exposure if he calls you. He looks like he's ready to let Chicago burn and you're not.

Trump: No, it's a great city, potentially a great city again and they've got to fix it. They've got to do what I did in Washington DC, which is -- it's the same thing on a larger scale. Washington DC is now so safe. The restaurants are booming. The whole place -- nobody's being shot and killed. They come in from Iowa, Indiana, they come from all over the country, and they end up getting a phone call, the parents, that their son was killed. Not anymore. It's a safe city. We arrested 1,700 career criminals. We got a lot of them out of the country, took them out. They're never coming back. And Chicago is safe. Now it's really safe. It's gone from a very unsafe city to very safe. Now we're doing Memphis and we're doing other things too. We've already had FBI in Chicago; they've done an incredible job. We got it down a little bit, but the big surge is what you need and we're going to be going in. We're going to save Chicago and that's what you have to do is save Chicago.

Kelly: The hostages, you know, you had a lot of momentum last week. It still feels like there's momentum. I'm hearing about talks in Egypt. Can you update us on when they will be coming home? How close are we?

Trump: Well, I think we're getting very close, and you know it's been going on for -- there are those that say 3,000 years, let's say a couple of hundred years, OK, let's say a few centuries. But it's -- you know, many, many years. It's been going on forever. And I think we're very, very close to having a deal. We have all of the Arab nations. We have all of the Muslim nations. We have many, many just -- I mean, the world is in favor of having this deal done. It's a very specific deal and it will bring peace to the Middle East -- beyond Gaza, it will bring peace to the Middle East. And I think there's a lot of goodwill being shown now.

It's pretty amazing actually, if we pull this one off, we've -- you know, I've solved seven wars. This one, I thought frankly Russia would be maybe the easiest because I know Putin, I got along with Putin very well. And I thought that that would be the easiest, it wasn't. But I solved ones that they didn't think there was a chance. One of the big ones was Pakistan and India, which could have been a -- you know, seven planes were shot down, and it was heading for a bad one. That's a nuclear -- two nuclear nations. But the one they say will be maybe the greatest of them all is the Middle East, if we could solve the Middle East because it's been going on literally for 3,000 years.

Kelly: You know the judge -- you've been blocked by these federal judges, the one giving you a hard time in Oregon, which drives me crazy, there's one -- there are 95 of these district judges. The Insurrection Act, is that going to be formally invoked? Is that a way to kind of get around all this opposition?

Trump: Well, it is a way to get around it. If we don't have to use it I wouldn't use it. If you take a look at what's been going on in Portland, it's been going on for a long time and that's insurrection -- I mean that's pure insurrection. And then you have a governor get up and say there's absolutely nothing wrong. And you see these places are burning down. Like in Chicago with Pritzker. They lose five a weekend, six, seven, eight, 10, 11.

Kelly: Thirty.

Trump: It's crazy. And you know, like 35 are shot. You look at some of the bigger weekends and they'll have 11 dead, 11 murdered, and 50 shot. And then he gets up on television and tells everyone how safe it is. It's not safe. And we'll make it safe; I can make it safe. We can make it safe easily and it won't even take that long. And the biggest problem we have is that they fight, they just fight, I guess. I don't know what it is. It's a sickness. They don't want -- why would you not let the military come in, meaning National Guard or whatever? And you know, when they interview -- very interesting, they interviewed people before and something and I'm watching and a woman said, I don't care who they bring in, people are being killed here.

I just want it to stop. They can bring in whoever they want. People don't care. They want it to stop and that's what we did. We brought in the National Guard into DC and it's now one of the safest. It went from a very unsafe city to one of the safest cities in the country. All it took -- you know, it took 12 days and then let's say give us a couple of more days after that, figure a month, but it took 12 days before the crime really stopped and after it stopped. And you know, our soldiers are not politically correct. These are -- we won the case on merit at the Supreme Court. These people are there for merit. They're there because they should be there and they look like soldiers. And they went in and they just cleaned it up. And they're doing the same thing right now in Memphis, Tennessee.

They're doing a great job. In just a few days, it's almost better. It's getting really good, really fast. We'll do the same thing in Chicago, and we'll do it in other places that need it. We saved Los Angeles. I'll tell you, if you -- look, you know, we did this a few months ago with Gavin Newscum in Los Angeles and we saved it. That place, it would have burned to the ground. And the head police person in Los Angeles said if they didn't do this, we wouldn't -- they totally lost control. By the way, two weeks later he was saying no, they could have done it themselves, you know, it's the old story. But we literally saved Los Angeles from burning to the ground, along with the other half that burned to the ground because Newsom didn't have any water, you know, but anyway.

Kelly: You know, there's -- the NFL just chose the Bad Bunny rabbit or whatever his name. This guy who hates ICE, he doesn't like you. He accuses everything he doesn't like of racism. Do you think maybe we should just kind of entertain blowing off the NFL? Like a boycott or something along those lines? This guy does not seem like a unifying entertainer and a lot of folks don't even know who he is.

Trump: I never heard of him. I don't know who he is. I don't know why they're doing it. It's like crazy. Then they blame it on some promoter that they hired to pick up entertainment. I think it's absolutely ridiculous. And while we're at it, I'd like them to change the kickoff rule, which looks ridiculous when the ball is kicked and the ball is floating in the air and everyone is standing there watching it, it's ridiculous. It's not any safer than the regular kickoff. I think it looks -- it just looks so terrible. I think it really demeans football, to be honest with you. It's a great game, but it demeans football. Do you know what I mean by that? The kickoff rule, the new kickoff rule, it's ridiculous.

Kelly: So, President Trump, you know, there are some good people at Fox News, but let's face it, a good chunk of them also did not support you in '16 and in '20 and again in '24. What do you make of that opposition? And it's -- you notice it, I know you do, I saw you put it on Truth Social. They seem to be at war with conservatives they don't like, and they gave you a really hard time at times over the past, well, nine years.

Trump: Well, but I've had many that have been really loyal and really great. I mean, you know, if you look at Sean Hannity and some of the others, I mean, they've been -- they couldn't be better. But there's an undertow there, there's like an undercurrent that goes there. Like with polls, I have the best polls I've ever had, but Fox never gives you -- My numbers are good no matter what they do because they're still good.

Trump: We have the best numbers I've ever had actually, but it's always lower with Fox than it is with others. And I don't -- you know, I really don't understand it, but I don't spend too much time thinking about it or understanding it. But, look, we have some great people. It's like everywhere else, you have some great people, there are some great people and there are some people I don't like very much.

Kelly: I know you have some people nearby, but real quick, you're working very hard. We've looked at August, and there literally was not a day where you were not available to the public. You're speaking. You're with us right now at 9:15 at night, Biden would have been out of commission for three hours. How are you holding up? And I heard about you and you don't need that much sleep, but wow, this is -- it's very impressive.

Trump: Well, I appreciate it. I think I'm holding up great. I love what I'm doing with Saving America. If I wasn't -- I don't say this in a braggadocious way, but I saw what we had for four years and it's why I did it again. I saw what they -- you know, open borders and people, millions of people pouring into our country from jails and mental institutions and drug dealers and everything else just pouring in here totally unchecked, totally unvetted. And I saw what was going on and I'm just telling you if that side got elected, I don't think this country could have existed for another two years. I really don't believe it. You know, when you look at what we're doing with energy and we're leading the world on energy, we're leading the world on AI. We have $17 trillion coming into the country from investments.

No country has ever had anything like that. With Biden they had less than $1 trillion for four years. I have 17 -- more than $17 trillion it's going to be -- and we're talking a matter of months, you know, a fraction of a year, not the whole year meaning. And you know, it's amazing what's happening. And I say it all the time. I use it because the king of Saudi Arabia said it to me. He said, you know, if you really look back one year ago -- this was a few months ago, one year ago he said your country was dead. It was a dead country. Now it's the hottest country in the world. And we do -- we have the hottest country in the world and we're doing better.

Look, we have a record stock market right now. It's the things that are happening and the things that are going to be happening over the next year and a half, two years -- AI, we're leading China. We're leading the whole world on AI. The car plants are all moving back. They're all coming back. And you know it better than just about anybody because you talk about it all the time. They're all coming back and the tariffs -- I think it's November 5th, meaning the election, and the tariffs, those two things are the reason they're coming. But everyone's coming back. The car companies are coming back like you wouldn't believe. You know what's going on, they're leaving other countries and coming into the USA. So, it's a very exciting time.

Very, very exciting. And you know, as far as that is concerned, I feel the same or better than I did 30 years ago. I feel the same, you know, let's say the same. I don't know if you can feel better, but I probably feel better, but let's not even talk about it because who knows. Who knows? Life is complex. But I feel literally better than I did 30, 40 years ago.

Kelly: Well, that's amazing. We want you to be safe. Hey, you know who I want to get well? Mark Sanchez. I know you know him a little bit from New York, he saw that.

Trump: Yeah. It's too bad. He's a nice guy. I don't know what happened, something bad happened. Something a little crazy happened, but he was -- I mean, I can only report that he was a nice guy. I know him a little bit.

Kelly: Before we go just -- Jack Smith, we just found out that he had some of your key allies under surveillance, wiretapping, finding their phone records, everybody from Tommy Tuberville, Lindsey Graham, Bill Hagerty, Senator from Tennessee. Did you hear about this? I did not. Nobody had any idea.

Trump: A little while ago, I did. He was a sleazebag, Jack Smith. He was a bad guy, terrible guy, always went too far. He was a violent, horrible prosecutor and he's paying the price. I tell you what, what he did to the lives of so many people and he tried on me. This guy was a bad guy. And you know the reason he lost is because he went too far. When you go too far, sometimes -- sometimes you get away with it, but they didn't get away with it here. Jack Smith was a sick person.

Kelly: President Trump, we're so fortunate, in my opinion, and this is an opinion show, that you are the president, and we're so grateful that you called in tonight. I thank you very much.

Trump: Well, it's my honor. You take care. Keep up the good work, Greg, you're doing some job.

Kelly: Thank you, sir, very much.

Trump: Thank you very much. Bye.

Kelly: All the best.
