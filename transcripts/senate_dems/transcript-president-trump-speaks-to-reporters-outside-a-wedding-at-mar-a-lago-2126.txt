================================================================================

President Trump : How are you Brian?

Question : How are you doing, Mr. President?

Trump : We have a big day. One of our great people, Dan, Erin, they're getting married. That's a, that's a big day. Very loyal, very fantastic people.

Question : Sir, uh, on Iran, uh, the Supreme Leader today said that, uh, US attacks could spark a regional war. Do you have any thoughts on that?

Trump : Why wouldn't he say that? Of course, he's gonna say that. But, uh, we have the biggest, most powerful ships in the world over there. Very close, couple of days. And, uh, hopefully we'll make a deal. If we don't make a deal then, uh, we'll find out whether or not he was right.

Question : Mr. President, on Texas, um, a Democrat won the special election in a area that you had won by 17 points. What is your reaction to that?

Trump : I don't know. I didn't hear about it. Somebody ran where?

Question : In Texas, a special election for legislative. The ninth state senate seat.

Trump : I'm not involved with that. That's a local Texas race. You mean I won by 17?

Question : You did.

Trump : And, uh, this person lost?

Question : A Republican.

Trump : Things like that happen.

Question : Does it worry you about the --

Trump : Well, you don't know whether or not it's transferrable, you know. I'm not on the ballot, so you don't know whether or not it's transferrable. Uh, you know, you put the Democrats in, you'll end up with open borders again. You'll end up with crime all over the place. They have no crime anymore. And I mean, think of it. The country has the lowest crime it's had in 125 years. In recorded history, the year 1900, that's a long time ago. So, it's, uh, very good. No, I don't know anything about it. I didn't know. I mean, I know there's a race going there. And, uh, it's too bad. What can I say? I have nothing to do with it. Yeah.

Question : Sir, what do you want out of a Cuba deal?

Trump : Well, Cuba's a failing nation. It has been for a long time, but now it doesn't have Venezuela to prop it up. Uh, so we're talking to the people from Cuba, the highest people in Cuba. We'll see what happens. Uh, I want the people that came here that were horribly treated by Cuba to be taken care of, to be able to go back, and do what they have to do. Uh, you know, they have their family there. They haven't been able to see them in years, many, many years. Uh, so, uh, I think we're gonna make a deal with Cuba.

Question : Mr. President, now, back to Texas.

Trump : It's in bad shape. Cuba is in bad shape.

Question : D- --

Trump : Cuba has a humanitarian problem.

Question : Do you have any plans to endorse in that Senate race? Has your mind change at all?

Trump : Which Senate race?

Question : In Texas, the GOP primary.

Trump : I, I'm giving it a very serious thought. You know, my problem is I'm friendly with all of them.

Question : Mm-hmm.

Trump : Those are the hard ones. I like all of them, all three. But, uh, you'll be seeing soon, okay? They say whoever I endorse wins, that's probably right.

Question : Do you support all federal border patrol agents and ICE wearing body cams?

Trump : We'll be talking about that in the near future, okay?

Question : We're going right now.

Trump : But you saw my note that I put out yesterday, that was pretty, I think it was pretty conclusive. Look, we stopped crime in our country, and the border is the best it's ever been. Thank you very much. I gotta go to a wedding.

Question : Thank you.
