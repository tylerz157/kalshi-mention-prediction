================================================================================

President Trump: So we saw a great game tonight. Congratulations to Indiana. It was a really, turned out to be a great game. Two great teams, wonderful teams, with a lot of talent. We enjoyed it very much. Our country is doing very well. We have many, many buildings opening, factories opening. We've never had anything like it. And I think you're going to see results very soon. You're already really seeing them. But we have more money being invested in our country than any country in history. Uh, as you know, the Secretary of the Interior, Doug Burgum, who's with me right now, uh, has a lot to report. I don't know if you wanna say a couple of words, Doug, but you might wanna say how well we're doing as a country.

Doug Burgum: Well, with President Trump's leadership, we got inflation coming down, we've got investment going up, we've got taxes going down. Uh, we've got energy prices down. There, everything is aligned for us to have a banner year in 2026. Uh, and the, and the interest in building and investing in our country's never been greater.

Trump: There's never been anything like it. The money being invested in our country is unparalleled. There's never been anything even close, by many times more than China or any other country. Uh, do you have any questions.

Question: Davos, sir. What will be your message to the leaders at Davos?

Trump: Well, I think I have a lot of messages for Davos, but the primary message is how well the United States is doing. And I say it all the time. A year and a half ago, we were a dead country, and now we have the hottest country in the world. I mean, you're beneficiaries too. You look, some of you have, uh, 401(k)s. Uh, you don't have to tell me your numbers are the best they've ever been. And, uh, the stock market's at an all time high. It's, we are just doing great. So I think the message at Davos, we're leaving, uh, have an interesting time. We have a lot of meetings scheduled, but the, the message for Davos is how incredible our country is doing.

Question: Can you speak to the letter your wrote to the Prime Minister, saying that the Nobel Prize had influenced your thinking on Greenland?

Trump: No, I don't care about the Nobel Prize. First of all, a very fine woman felt that I deserved it and really wanted me to have the Nobel Prize, and I appreciate that. Uh, if anybody thinks that Norway doesn't, uh, doesn't control the Nobel Prize, they're just kidding. They have a board, but it's controlled by Norway. And I don't care what Norway says. But I really don't care about that. What I care about is saving lives. And I think I've saved tens of millions of lives. If you look at India, Pakistan just as one, two nuclear powers, you look at so many of the countries that were in a 30, in some cases, a 35 year war and I got it done. We stopped eight wars and maybe we'll be stopping a ninth very soon. We'll see.

Question: What about European leaders in Davos when they push back on your Greenland plan?

Trump: Well, I don't think they're gonna push back too much. Look, we have to have it. They have to have this done. They can't protect it. Denmark, they're wonderful people. And I know the leaders are very good people, but they, they don't even go there. And, you know, because a boat went there 500 years ago and then left, that doesn't give you title to property. So, uh, we'll be talking about it with the various people. We've had, we've had tremendous success and we've, you know, I've done more for NATO than anybody else. I don't think you'd have NATO right now. I got them to go 5% and pay as opposed to 2% and not pay. I've done more than any other American president for NATO, by far. And we'll see how that goes, but Greenland is very important.

Question: Have you invited President Putin to be a member of the Board of Peace?

Trump: Yeah, he's been invited.

Question: Do you have any response to President Macron saying he will not join the Board of Peace?

Trump: Oh, did he say that? Yeah. Well, nobody wants him because he's gonna be out of office very soon. So, you know, that's all right. What I'll do is if they feel like hostile, I'll put a 200% tariff on his wines and champagnes and he'll join. But he doesn't have to join. If he, if he says that, you're probably giving it to me a little bit differently. But if he actually did say that, but as you know, he's gonna be out of office in a few months.

Question: Did you invite President Putin to join the --

Trump: Yes. Uh, he's one of the people. These are world leaders and the answer is yes.

Question: Mr. President, how do you feel about the first year of your second term?

Trump: Amazing. Tomorrow is the first year. Think of it. One year. I don't think there's been a term like it. I don't think any president has had a better first year than we've had in terms of success. Again, we've taken our country from a failure with open borders, no business, everything going badly, terrific inflation, uh, the highest inflation in history, uh, prices that are through the roof. And we've brought prices down. We have very little inflation. We have a great economy, and the prices are coming down still further. But I inherited a mess, and now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world.

Question: Mr. President, do you think that you had any influence on the Giants signing the deal with Coach Harbaugh, and how do you think he will do in New York?

Trump: I don't know, but they got a great coach. Uh, I like the coach. I like his brother. They came up to see me with, uh, about three months ago, they came up to see me in the White House. Did you know that?

Question: Yes, I did.

Trump: With the mother and father, because the mother likes me and the father likes me, and I think they like me. And he's a great coach, and he's gonna do well with the Giants, just like his brother does so well. They, they are, they got something very special in their blood. And I'm happy for the Giants. They got a great coach. It's nice that you ask. I did put out a, I put out a strong word, "Hire Coach Harbaugh."

Question: Mr. President, can you tell us on the Fed, will you make your decision before Davos?

Trump: Yeah, I know who I want.

Question: You know who you want?

Trump: In the Fed.

Question: When will you make a decision?

Trump: I'll be, I'll announce it sometimes, but I know, I know who I want.

Question: [Inaudible] securing the Arctic from Russian threats to support you, why are you upset about NATO allies thinking that, you know, more seriously Greenland by holding military exercises?

Trump: Well, that wasn't a military, they sent a few people, and they say they sent them, not for me, but be to guard against Russia. But, you know, NATO's been warning, uh, Denmark for about 20 years now, longer than that, 25 years. They've been warning Denmark about the Russian threat. And it's not only Russia, it's also China. So we'll see what happens, but, uh, let's put it this way. It's gonna be a very interesting Davos. Goodbye, everybody. Have a good flight. Thank you.

Question: Thank you, Mr. President.
