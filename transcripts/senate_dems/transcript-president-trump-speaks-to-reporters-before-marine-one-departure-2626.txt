President Trump: As you probably saw today, the stock market, the Dow just hit 50,000, three years ahead of schedule. That probably couldn't be done in the four year period. We did it in one year. So we're three years ahead of schedule. Broke an all time record, 50,000, which they said couldn't happen. On the prime front, it was just announced that murders are down and crime is down. It's got the lowest point in 125 years, the year, 1900. And that's a big, big number. And the country's doing very well. Do you have any questions?

Question : What's the status of the Save Act? Have you talked to leadership about using the standing filibuster?

Trump : I'd love to use the filibuster. The Save Act is very important. Voter ID. I mean, if you look at it, no mail-in voting and you have to have proof of citizenship. Everybody wants it. The polls even with Democrats, it's falling at 82. With the Republican's the poll's at, Republicans at 99%. So we're going to be trying very hard to [Inaudible]

Question : Mr. President, good to see you sir. Rent prices continue to drop under your watch as president. What is the secret sauce of those prices coming down? Is it the deregulation, the mass deportation? What's the secret, sir?

Trump : We've had massive price reductions. In fact, you don't hear the Democrats with their arguments about affordability because they caused the problem, and I haven't heard that word now in two weeks. Prices are way down. Energy is way down. If you look at gasoline, $1.99 a gallon. And sometimes, as you saw last week in Iowa, it was $1.85 a gallon when we went to Iowa. So we have the prices coming way down. I think we have the best economy maybe we've ever had. But again, I mean, to me, the picture is 50,000, the Dow hit. And most people felt if I could do that in my fourth year, we did it in my first year, so [Inaudible].

Note: [Crosstalk]

Trump : Thank you everyone.
