President Trump : Today I'm thrilled to announce my plan to lower healthcare prices for all Americans and truly make healthcare affordable again. We're doing things that nobody's ever been able to do. We're calling it The Great Healthcare Plan. Instead of putting the needs of big corporations and special interests first, our plan finally puts you first and puts more money in your pocket.

The government is going to pay the money directly to you. It goes to you, and then you take the money and buy your own healthcare. Nobody's ever heard of that before, and that's the way it is. The big insurance companies lose and the people of our country win. This proposal locks in the massive discounts on prescription drugs that my administration is achieving through our most-favored-nation drug pricing agreement.

Now, when you hear about that for 40 years, they've been trying to do it, but they're never able to do it. No other president was able to do it. I got every other country to approve it. By the use of tariffs and other things, they all approved it. Nobody else got it. No other president got it. And for the most part, they didn't even try because they felt it was impossible.

It'll bring down drug prices 80%, 90% in some cases. Just numbers that nobody's ever heard of before. Your prescription drugs will come way, way down. And under this policy, the prices of many drugs will be slashed by 300%, 400%, and even 500% starting this month at the Trumprx.gov. So, instead of Americans paying the highest drug prices in the world, which we have for decades, we will now be paying the lowest cost paid by any other nation.

So, any other nation that's paying the lowest cost, that's what we're gonna pay. And the American people will get the savings. So, I have to e- -- reiterate, the lowest price in the world is what you're gonna pay. Before, you were paying the highest price in the world by far, and the politicians did nothing about it. So, I'm asking Congress to complete the work that we've started.

Next, my plan would reduce your insurance premiums by stopping government payoffs to big insurance companies and sending that money directly to the people. Obamacare was designed to make insurance companies rich. I call it the Unaffordable Care Act with billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies that helped their stock prices skyrocket over 1,700%. As you paid more money for healthcare every single year, more and more, the premiums went higher and higher.

I wanna end this flagrant scam and put extra money straight into the healthcare savings account in your name and you go out and buy your own healthcare, and you'll make a great deal. You get better healthcare for less money. That way, you can choose the care that is right for your family. To further reduce insurance premiums, my plan ends the giant kickbacks to insurance brokers and corporate middlemen that only drive up the costs, and that's what they're intended to, drive up the cost, but we're driving down the cost.

And it fully funds a long, neglected part of the law known as the Cost Sharing Reduction Program. This measure alone should cut premiums on the most popular Obamacare plans. It's hard to believe there are any, because it's a hated program. It's unaffordable, but it's gonna cut them by an average of 10% to 15%. Next, The Great Healthcare Plan -- that's the name.

It's called The Great Healthcare, because it's great healthcare at a lower price. Mandates unprecedented accountability and transparency from insurance companies and all healthcare providers, so that special interests can no longer profiteer at your expense. As the saying goes, "Sunlight is the best disinfectant." That is why my plan orders all insurance companies to publish rate and coverage comparisons in very plain English.

It requires insurers to publish detailed information about how much of your money they're going to be paying out in claims versus how much they're taken in, in profits. In other words, you will be able to watch the scam. It forces them to release detailed data on how many claims are being denied, and whether those denials are eventually overturned on appeal.

And most importantly, it will require any hospital or insurer who accepts a Medicare or Medicaid to prominently post all prices at their place of business so that you are never surprised and you can easily shop for a better deal or a better care, and you're gonna end up doing both. You're gonna get a better deal and better care.

We will have maximum price transparency, and costs will come down incredibly. I'm calling on Congress to pass this framework into law without delay. Have to do it right now, so that we can get immediate relief to the American people, the people I love. Thank you very much.
