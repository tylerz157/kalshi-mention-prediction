ADDITIONAL SOURCES FOR TRUMP TRANSCRIPT SCRAPING
================================================================================
Compiled: February 26, 2026
Purpose: Guide for obtaining additional raw transcript data for LLM fine-tuning
to predict Trump speech patterns on Kalshi mention markets.

PRIORITY: Q&A formats (gaggles, interviews, press conferences) > Informal remarks
> Formal prepared speeches. Q&A formats produce the widest vocabulary range and
most natural/unpredictable speech patterns -- critical for mention market prediction.

================================================================================
SCRAPING STRATEGY RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. START WITH Senate Democrats archive - it's the richest single source
   with 300+ transcripts all in consistent format. Write a scraper that:
   a) Paginates through all 16 index pages
   b) Extracts individual transcript URLs
   c) Fetches each transcript page
   d) Extracts text between [Video] marker and "Transcript courtesy" footer
   e) Saves with metadata (date, event type, format)

2. SUPPLEMENT WITH Rev.com for 2024 campaign rallies and interviews

3. ADD first-term speeches from Trump White House Archives for baseline

4. PRIORITIZE by format:
   - Q&A gaggles and press conferences (highest prediction value)
   - Long-form interviews and podcasts (rare vocabulary)
   - Rally speeches (informal, improvisational)
   - Formal addresses (prepared text, less variation)

5. TAG each transcript with:
   - Date
   - Event type (gaggle, rally, interview, formal_speech, etc.)
   - Topics discussed
   - Format (Q&A, monologue, mixed)
   - Approximate word count
   - Whether prepared/teleprompter or improvisational
