Well, I want to thank you all and welcome you to the White House on this very special occasion. It is indeed, I've been at every one of them, and we celebrate the 100th anniversary of Black History Month. That's a big deal. 100th. Wow, that's sort of special. The 100th. Like 150's good, but 200's better, right? 100's better. I want to begin by expressing our sadness at the passing of a person who I knew very well. Jesse was a piece of work, I want to tell you. He was a piece of work, but he was a good man.</div></div></div>

He was actually, as you got to know him, he got better and better all the time. A lot of people, you get to know them they get worse and worse. Jesse got better and better. But I knew him well long before becoming president, and he really was special with lots of personality, grit, and street smarts. You would say Jesse had serious street smarts, right? A very important ingredient to life, I will tell you. He was gregarious and someone who truly loved people, and a force of nature. He was somebody that we're going to greatly miss, and on behalf of everyone here today, I know you join me in sending our condolences to the entire family.</div></div></div>

Come here. I got to get him. And his wonderful wife, Candy. Candy, I'm going to steal Ben for a second, because Ben recommended Scott. And when Ben recommends somebody, I just do it. Did I make a good decision? Be careful, don't fall, Ben. If you fall, that's the end. You can never recover from a fall. You can make the greatest speech ever, but if you fall... My predecessor taught me that. So is Scott doing a good job, Ben?</div></div></div>

And it is working, as are all the other things that he's been recommending. And at some point the mainstream media will recognize that you don't politicize everything. You open your eyes and your ears and you look and you see what works, and you'll deal with that. But the best thing about Scott, he's got a lot of energy. I'm an old man now, I'll be 75 on my next birthday, and I'm not like President Trump, he just goes forever.</div></div></div>

And so to stand now as the servant leader and the Secretary of HUD, I'm grateful to the Lord, I'm grateful to the President and Dr. Carson, and I promise you we will continue to do good work, and to make not just housing affordable and everybody achieve the American dream, but really to bring transformation, and so that those that are in our country who depend on subsidies and this, that, and the other will get off of that and live a life of self-sustainability.

It's the highest award you can have, outside of the Congressional Medal of Honor. But it's better, because a lot of people get the Congressional Medal of Honor, they're not around. When you get them, they're not around. Whereas we don't have to go that far, generally speaking. But it's the highest award, civilian. And then you have the matching, is the Congressional Medal of Honor. Both tremendous. So Ben, I'll be seeing you back here pretty soon, I think, and you're going to get the award, you'll probably fill up this room.

I was able to hire seven more employees just by what you did. Not only that, I was able to open a second location on our college campus. Things are just going off simply because having now faith.

But as a small business owner, I understand how critical support is. I understand that you have to have the right people that make the right policies for us as small business owners. So no tax on tips has been a extremely blessing for me and my business, not just mine, but I know so many people across the country. I know a lot of us don't want to talk about the good part of it. We only want to share the negative. But I'm here today to tell you you've done a great thing.

We need law and order. You know Washington D.C. is amazing. It was a crime capital. It was a horror show. A year ago it was really dangerous. And now it's one of the safest cities anywhere in the country. And we're in Memphis, Tennessee now where it's like a different world. In four months, we've made it safe. We are in Louisiana, as you know, lots of other places, and we have the lowest crime numbers that we've had in many years. We have the lowest murder numbers in 125 years since 1900. And that's despite the fact that a lot of people are here. But those people have been taken out. Lots of them have been taken out. That's why we stopped the invasion at the southern border.</div></div></div>
